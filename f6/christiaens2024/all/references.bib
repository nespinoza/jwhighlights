	abstract = {We present L'-band imaging of the PDS 70 planetary system with Keck/NIRC2 using the new infrared pyramid wave front sensor. We detected both PDS 70 b and c in our images, as well as the front rim of the circumstellar disk. After subtracting off a model of the disk, we measured the astrometry and photometry of both planets. Placing priors based on the dynamics of the system, we estimated PDS 70 b to have a semimajor axis of $ 20 _ -4 ^ +3 $ au and PDS 70 c to have a semimajor axis of $ 34 _ -6 ^ +12 $ au (95% credible interval). We fit the spectral energy distribution (SED) of both planets. For PDS 70 b, we were able to place better constraints on the red half of its SED than previous studies and inferred the radius of the photosphere to be 2-3 R<SUB>Jup</SUB>. The SED of PDS 70 c is less well constrained, with a range of total luminosities spanning an order of magnitude. With our inferred radii and luminosities, we used evolutionary models of accreting protoplanets to derive a mass of PDS 70 b between 2 and 4 M<SUB>Jup</SUB> and a mean mass accretion rate between 3 × 10<SUP>-7</SUP> and 8 × 10<SUP>-7</SUP> M<SUB>Jup</SUB>/yr. For PDS 70 c, we computed a mass between 1 and 3 M<SUB>Jup</SUB> and mean mass accretion rate between 1 × 10<SUP>-7</SUP> and 5 × 10<SUP>-7</SUP> M<SUB>Jup</SUB>/yr. The mass accretion rates imply dust accretion timescales short enough to hide strong molecular absorption features in both planets' SEDs.},

	abstract = {GQ Lup B is a young and accreting, substellar companion that appears to drive a spiral arm in the circumstellar disk of its host star. We report high-contrast imaging observations of GQ Lup B with VLT/NACO at 4-5 μm and medium-resolution integral field spectroscopy with VLT/MUSE. The optical spectrum is consistent with an M9 spectral type, shows characteristics of a low-gravity atmosphere, and exhibits strong Hα emission. The H - M' color is ≳1 mag redder than field dwarfs with similar spectral types, and a detailed analysis of the spectral energy distribution (SED) from optical to mid-infrared wavelengths reveals excess emission in the L', NB4.05, and M' bands. The excess flux is well described by a blackbody component with T <SUB>disk</SUB> ≈ 460 K and R <SUB>disk</SUB> ≈ 65 R <SUB>J</SUB> and is expected to trace continuum emission from small grains in a protolunar disk. We derive an extinction of A <SUB> V </SUB> ≈ 2.3 mag from the broadband SED with a suspected origin in the vicinity of the companion. We also combine 15 yr of astrometric measurements and constrain the mutual inclination with the circumstellar disk to 84 $\pm$ 9 deg, indicating a tumultuous dynamical evolution or a stellar-like formation pathway. From the measured Hα flux and the estimated companion mass, M <SUB>p</SUB> ≈ 30 M <SUB>J</SUB>, we derive an accretion rate of $\dot M \approx  10 ^ -6.5 \, M _  \rm J   \, \mathrm yr  ^ -1 $ . We speculate that the disk is in a transitional stage in which the assembly of satellites from a pebble reservoir has opened a central cavity while GQ Lup B is in the final stages of its formation. ∗Based on observations collected under ESO programmes 0101.C-0502(B), 0102.C-0649(A), and 0103.C-0524(A).},

The source is found at a separation of 0$ _ . ^ \prime\prime  $319 (~37 au) from the star. Three lines of evidence argue in favour of the signal tracing a protoplanet: (i) it is found in the annular gap separating the two bright rings of the disc, as predicted by theory; (ii) it is moving at the expected Keplerian velocity for an object at ~37 au in the 2015, 2017, and 2019 data sets; and (iii) we also detect a spiral-shaped signal whose morphology is consistent with the expected outer spiral wake triggered by a planet in the gap, based on dedicated hydrodynamical simulations of the system. The YJH colours we extracted for the object are consistent with tracing scattered starlight, suggesting that the protoplanet is enshrouded in a significant amount of dust, as expected for a circumplanetary disc or envelope surrounding a gap-clearing Jovian-mass protoplanet.},

@article{Juillard2022,
	abstract = {Context. Observing dynamical interactions between planets and disks is key to understanding their formation and evolution. Two protoplanets have recently been discovered within the PDS 70 protoplanetary disk, along with an arm-like structure toward the northwest of the star. <BR /> Aims: Our aim is to constrain the morphology and origin of this arm-like structure, and to assess whether it could trace a spiral density wave caused by the dynamical interaction between the planet PDS 70c and the disk. <BR /> Methods: We analyzed polarized and angular differential imaging (PDI and ADI) data taken with VLT/SPHERE, spanning six years of observations. The PDI data sets were reduced using the irdap polarimetric data reduction pipeline, while the ADI data sets were processed using mustard, a novel algorithm based on an inverse problem approach to tackle the geometrical biases spoiling the images previously used for the analysis of this disk. <BR /> Results: We confirm the presence of the arm-like structure in all PDI and ADI data sets, and extract its trace by identifying local radial maxima in azimuthal slices of the disk in each data set. We do not observe a southeast symmetric arm with respect to the disk minor axis, which seems to disfavor the previous hypothesis that the arm is the footprint of a double-ring structure. If the structure traces a spiral density wave following the motion of PDS 70c, we would expect 11$\,^{\circ}$.28<SUB>−0$\,^{\circ}$.86</SUB><SUP>+2$\,^{\circ}$.20</SUP> rotation for the spiral in six years. However, we do not measure any significant movement of the structure. <BR /> Conclusions: If the arm-like structure is a planet-driven spiral arm, the observed lack of rotation would suggest that the assumption of rigid-body rotation may be inappropriate for spirals induced by planets. We suggest that the arm-like structure may instead trace a vortex appearing as a one-armed spiral in scattered light due to projection effects. The vortex hypothesis accounts for both the lack of observed rotation and the presence of a nearby sub-millimeter continuum asymmetry detected with ALMA. Additional follow-up observations and dedicated hydrodynamical simulations could confirm this hypothesis.},

	abstract = {HD 163296 is a Herbig Ae/Be star known to host a protoplanetary disc with a ringed structure. To explain the disc features, previous works proposed the presence of planets embedded into the disc. We have observed HD 163296 with the near-infrared (NIR) branch of SPHERE composed by IRDIS (InfraRed Dual-band Imager and Spectrograph) and IFS (integral field spectrograph) with the aim to put tight constraints on the presence of substellar companions around this star. Despite the low rotation of the field of view during our observation we were able to put upper mass limits of few M<SUB>Jup</SUB> around this object. These limits do not allow to give any definitive conclusion about the planets proposed through the disc characteristics. On the other hand, our results seem to exclude the presence of the only candidate proposed until now using direct imaging in the NIR even if some caution has to be taken considered the different wavelength bands of the two observations.},

	abstract = {We present a semi-analytical population synthesis model of protoplanetary clumps formed by disk instability at radial distances of 80-120 au. Various clump density profiles, initial mass functions, protoplanetary disk models, stellar masses, and gap opening criteria are considered. When we use more realistic gap opening criteria, we find that gaps open only rarely, which strongly affects clump survival rates and their physical properties (mass, radius, and radial distance). The inferred surviving population is then shifted toward less massive clumps at smaller radial distances. We also find that populations of surviving clumps are very sensitive to the model assumptions and used parameters. Depending on the chosen parameters, the protoplanets occupy a mass range between 0.01 and 16 M <SUB>J</SUB> and may either orbit close to the central star or as far out as 75 au, with a sweet spot at 10-30 au for the massive ones. However, in all of the cases we consider, we find that massive giant planets at very large radial distances are rare, in qualitative agreement with current direct imaging surveys. We conclude that caution should be taken in deriving population synthesis models as well as when comparing the models' results with observations.},

	abstract = {Context. Direct imaging provides a steady flow of newly discovered giant planets and brown dwarf companions. These multi-object systems can provide information about the formation of low-mass companions in wide orbits and/or help us to speculate about possible migration scenarios. Accurate classification of companions is crucial for testing formation pathways. <BR /> Aims: In this work we further characterise the recently discovered candidate for a planetary-mass companion CS Cha b and determine if it is still accreting. <BR /> Methods: MUSE is a four-laser-adaptive-optics-assisted medium-resolution integral-field spectrograph in the optical part of the spectrum. We observed the CS Cha system to obtain the first spectrum of CS Cha b. The companion is characterised by modelling both the spectrum from 6300 {\AA} to 9300 {\AA} and the photometry using archival data from the visible to the near-infrared (NIR). <BR /> Results: We find evidence of accretion and outflow signatures in Hα and OI emission. The atmospheric models with the highest likelihood indicate an effective temperature of 3450 $\pm$ 50 K with a log g of 3.6 $\pm$ 0.5 dex. Based on evolutionary models, we find that the majority of the object is obscured. We determine the mass of the faint companion with several methods to be between 0.07 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and 0.71 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> with an accretion rate of {\.M} = 4 × 10<SUP>-11$\pm$0.4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. <BR /> Conclusions: Our results show that CS Cha B is most likely a mid-M-type star that is obscured by a highly inclined disc, which has led to its previous classification using broadband NIR photometry as a planetary-mass companion. This shows that it is important and necessary to observe over a broad spectral range to constrain the nature of faint companions. <P />The extracted spectrum of CS Cha B is only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr</A> (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via <A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/640/L12">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/640/L12</A>},

	abstract = {Context. Directly imaged planets and substellar companions are key targets for the characterization of self-luminous atmospheres. Their photometric appearance at 4-5 μm is sensitive to the chemical composition and cloud content of their atmosphere. <BR /> Aims: We aim to systematically characterize the atmospheres of directly imaged low-mass companions at 4-5 μm. We want to homogeneously process the data, provide robust flux measurements, and compile a photometric library at thermal wavelengths of these mostly young, low-gravity objects. In this way, we want to find trends related to their spectral type and surface gravity by comparing with isolated brown dwarfs and predictions from atmospheric models. <BR /> Methods: We used the high-resolution, high-contrast capabilities of NACO at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) to directly image the companions of HIP 65426, PZ Tel, and HD 206893 in the NB4.05 and/or M' filters. For the same targets, and additionally β Pic, we also analyzed six archival VLT/NACO datasets which were taken with the NB3.74, L', NB4.05, and M' filters. The data processing and photometric extraction of the companions was done with PynPoint while the species toolkit was used to further analyze and interpret the fluxes and colors. <BR /> Results: We detect for the first time HIP 65426 b, PZ Tel B, and HD 206893 B in the NB4.05 filter, PZ Tel B and HD 206893 B in the M' filter, and β Pic b in the NB3.74 filter. We provide calibrated magnitudes and fluxes with a careful analysis of the error budget, both for the new and archival datasets. The L'-NB4.05 and L'-M' colors of the studied sample are all red while the NB4.05-M' color is blue for β Pic b, gray for PZ Tel B, and red for HIP 65426 b and HD 206893 B (although typically with low significance). The absolute NB4.05 and M' fluxes of our sample are all larger than those of field dwarfs with similar spectral types. Finally, the surface gravity of β Pic b has been constrained to log g = 4.17<SUB>-0.13</SUB><SUP>+0.10</SUP> dex from its photometry and dynamical mass. <BR /> Conclusions: A red color at 3-4 μm and a blue color at 4-5 μm might be (partially) caused by H<SUB>2</SUB>O and CO absorption, respectively, which are expected to be the most dominant gaseous opacities in hot (T<SUB>eff</SUB> ≳ 1300 K) atmospheres. The red characteristics of β Pic b, HIP 65426 b, and HD 206893 B at 3-5μm, as well as their higher fluxes in NB4.05 and M' compared to field dwarfs, indicate that cloud densities are enhanced close to the photosphere as a result of their low surface gravity. <P />Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, Chile, ESO No. 085.C-0277(B), 090.C-0396(B), 095.C-0937(B), 199.C-0065(A), 0101.C-0588(A), and 0102.C-0649(A).},

	abstract = {We present the first observational evidence for a circumplanetary disk (CPD) around the protoplanet PDS 70 b, based on a new spectrum in the K-band acquired with Very Large Telescope/SINFONI. We tested three hypotheses to explain the spectrum: atmospheric emission from the planet with either (1) a single value of extinction, (2) a variable extinction, and (3) a combined atmospheric and CPD model. Goodness-of-fit indicators favor the third option, suggesting that circumplanetary material contributes excess thermal emission---most prominent at λ ≳ 2.3 μm. Inferred accretion rates (∼10<SUP>-7.8</SUP>-10<SUP>-7.3</SUP> M <SUB> J </SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>) are compatible with observational constraints based on the Hα and Brγ lines. For the planet, we derive an effective temperature of 1500-1600 K, surface gravity  log (g)∼ 4.0, radius ∼1.6R <SUB> J </SUB>, mass ∼10M <SUB> J </SUB>, and possible thick clouds. Models with variable extinction lead to slightly worse fits. However, the amplitude (ΔA <SUB> V </SUB> ≳ 3 mag) and timescale of variation (≲years) required for the extinction would also suggest circumplanetary material.},

	abstract = {Transition discs are prime targets to look for protoplanets and study planet-disc interactions. We present VLT/SINFONI observations of PDS 70, a transition disc with a recently claimed embedded protoplanet. We take advantage of the angular and spectral diversity present in our data for an optimal PSF modelling and subtraction using principal component analysis (PCA). We report the redetection of PDS 70 b, both the front and far side of the outer disc edge, and the detection of several extended features in the annular gap. We compare spectral differential imaging applied before (PCA-SADI), and after (PCA-ASDI) angular differential imaging. Our tests suggest that PCA-SADI better recovers extended features, while PCA-ASDI is more sensitive to point sources. We adapted the negative fake companion (NEGFC) technique to infer the astrometry of the companion, and derived r = 193.5 $\pm$ 4.9 mas and PA =158.7<SUP>$\,^{\circ}$</SUP> $\pm$ 3.0<SUP>$\,^{\circ}$</SUP>. We used both NEGFC and ANDROMEDA to infer the K-band spectro-photometry of the protoplanet, and found results consistent with recent VLT/SPHERE observations, except for their 2018/02 epoch measurement in the K2 filter. Finally, we derived an upper limit of \dot M_b  &lt; 1.26 × 10^ -7  \big [ 5 M_Jup/M_b \big ] \big [ R_b/R_Jup\big ] M_Jup yr<SUP>-1</SUP> for the accretion rate of the companion based on an adaptation of PCA-SADI/PCA-ASDI around the Brγ line (assuming no extinction).},

	abstract = {Context. Imaged in the gap of a transition disk and found at a separation of about 195 mas ( 22 au) from its host star at a position angle of about 155$\,^{\circ}$, PDS 70 b is the most robustly detected young planet to date. This system is therefore a unique laboratory for characterizing the properties of young planetary systems at the stage of their formation. <BR /> Aims: We aim to trace direct and indirect imprints of PDS 70 b on the gas and dust emission of the circumstellar disk in order to study the properties of this 5 Myr young planetary system. <BR /> Methods: We obtained ALMA band 7 observations of PDS 70 in dust continuum and <SUP>12</SUP>CO (3-2) and combined them with archival data. This resulted in an unprecedented angular resolution of about 70 mas ( 8 au). <BR /> Results: We derive an upper limit on circumplanetary material at the location of PDS 70 b of 0.01 M<SUB>⊕</SUB> and find a highly structured circumstellar disk in both dust and gas. The outer dust ring peaks at 0.65'' (74 au) and reveals a possible second unresolved peak at about 0.53'' (60 au). The integrated intensity of CO also shows evidence of a depletion of emission at 0.2'' (23 au) with a width of 0.1'' (11 au). The gas kinematics show evidence of a deviation from Keplerian rotation inside ≲0.8'' (91 au). This implies a pressure gradient that can account for the location of the dust ring well beyond the location of PDS 70 b. Farther in, we detect an inner disk that appears to be connected to the outer disk by a possible bridge feature in the northwest region in both gas and dust. We compare the observations to hydrodynamical simulations that include a planet with different masses that cover the estimated mass range that was previously derived from near-infrared photometry ( 5-9 M<SUB>Jup</SUB>). We find that even a planet with a mass of 10 M<SUB>Jup</SUB> may not be sufficient to explain the extent of the wide gap, and an additional low-mass companion may be needed to account for the observed disk morphology.},

@article{Christiaens2021,
	abstract = {Understanding how giant planets form requires observational input from directly imaged protoplanets. We used VLT/NACO and VLT/SPHERE to search for companions in the transition disc of 2MASS J19005804-3645048 (hereafter CrA-9), an accreting M0.75 dwarf with an estimated age of 1-2 Myr. We found a faint point source at ∼0.7-arcsec separation from CrA-9 (∼108 au projected separation). Our 3-epoch astrometry rejects a fixed background star with a 5σ significance. The near-IR absolute magnitudes of the object point towards a planetary-mass companion. However, our analysis of the 1.0-3.8 $\,\mu$ m spectrum extracted for the companion suggests it is a young M5.5 dwarf, based on both the 1.13-μm Na index and comparison with templates of the Montreal Spectral Library. The observed spectrum is best reproduced with high effective temperature ( $3057^ +119 _ -36 $ K) BT-DUSTY and BT-SETTL models, but the corresponding photometric radius required to match the measured flux is only $0.60^ +0.01 _ -0.04 $ Jovian radius. We discuss possible explanations to reconcile our measurements, including an M-dwarf companion obscured by an edge-on circum-secondary disc or the shock-heated part of the photosphere of an accreting protoplanet. Follow-up observations covering a larger wavelength range and/or at finer spectral resolution are required to discriminate these two scenarios.},

	abstract = {We report a new evaluation of the accretion properties of PDS 70b obtained with the Very Large Telescope/Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer. The main difference from the previous studies of Haffert et al. and Aoyama &amp; Ikoma is in the mass accretion rate. Simultaneous multiple line observations, such as Hα and Hβ, can better constrain the physical properties of an accreting planet. While we clearly detected Hα emissions from PDS 70b, no Hβ emissions were detected. We estimate the line flux of Hβ with a 3σ upper limit to be 2.3 × 10<SUP>-16</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>. The flux ratio F<SUB>Hβ</SUB>/F<SUB>Hα</SUB> for PDS 70b is &lt;0.28.

The PDS 70b mass accretion rate is an order of magnitude larger than that of PDS 70.

	abstract = {Context. A large portion of stars is found to be part of binary or higher-order multiple systems. The ubiquity of planets found around single stars raises the question of whether and how planets in binary systems form. Protoplanetary disks are the birthplaces of planets, and characterizing them is crucial in order to understand the planet formation process. <BR /> Aims: Our goal is to characterize the morphology of the GG Tau A disk, one of the largest and most massive circumbinary disks. We also aim to trace evidence for binary-disk interactions. <BR /> Methods: We obtained observations in polarized scattered light of GG Tau A using the SPHERE/IRDIS instrument in the H-band filter. We analyzed the observed disk morphology and substructures. We ran 2D hydrodynamical models to simulate the evolution of the circumbinary ring over the lifetime of the disk. <BR /> Results: The disk and also the cavity and the inner region are highly structured, with several shadowed regions, spiral structures, and streamer-like filaments. Some of these are detected here for the first time. The streamer-like filaments appear to connect the outer ring with the northern arc. Their azimuthal spacing suggests that they may be generated through periodic perturbations by the binary, which tear off material from the inner edge of the outer disk once during each orbit. By comparing observations to hydrodynamical simulations, we find that the main features, in particular, the gap size, but also the spiral and streamer filaments, can be qualitatively explained by the gravitational interactions of a binary with a semimajor axis of ~35 au on an orbit coplanar with the circumbinary ring. <P />Based on observations performed with VLT/SPHERE under program ID 198.C-0209(N).},

We revealed complicated and asymmetrical structures in the inner part (lsim140 AU) of the disk while confirming the previously reported outer (r &gt;~ 200 AU) spiral structure. We have imaged a double ring structure at ~40 and ~100 AU and a ring-like gap between the two. We found a significant discrepancy of inclination angles between two rings, which may indicate that the disk of AB Aur is warped. Furthermore, we found seven dips (the typical size is ~45 AU or less) within two rings, as well as three prominent PI peaks at ~40 AU. The observed structures, including a bumpy double ring, a ring-like gap, and a warped disk in the innermost regions, provide essential information for understanding the formation mechanism of recently detected wide-orbit (r &gt; 20 AU) planets. <P />Based on data collected at the Subaru Telescope, which is operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan.},

	abstract = {We report a new evaluation of the accretion properties of PDS~70b obtained with VLT/MUSE. The main difference from previous studies in Haffert et al. (2019) and Aoyama &amp; Ikoma (2019) is in the mass accretion rate. Simultaneous multiple line observations, such as H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$, can better constrain the physical properties of an accreting planet. While we clearly detected H$\alpha$ emissions from PDS~70b, no H$\beta$ emissions were detected. We estimate the line flux of H$\beta$ with a 3-$\sigma$ upper limit to be 2.3~$\times$~10$^ -16 $~erg~s$^ -1 $~cm$^ -2 $. The flux ratio $F_ \rm H\beta $/$F_ \rm H\alpha $ for PDS~70b is $&lt;$~0.28. Numerical investigations by Aoyama et al. (2018) suggest that $F_ \rm H\beta $/$F_ \rm H\alpha $ should be close to unity if the extinction is negligible. We attribute the reduction of the flux ratio to the extinction, and estimate the extinction of H$\alpha$ ($A_ \rm H\alpha $) for PDS~70b to be $&gt;$~2.0~mag using the interstellar extinction value. %The expected $A_ \rm H\alpha $ value in the gap of the protoplanetary disk at the PDS~70b location is 2.4~mag, which is consistent with the estimated extinction. By combining with the H$\alpha$ linewidth and the dereddening line luminosity of H$\alpha$, %we derive the PDS~70b dynamical mass and mass accretion rate to be \hashimotor 12~$\pm$~3~$M_ \rm Jup $  and $\gtrsim$~5~$\times$~10$^ -7 $~$M_ \rm Jup $~yr$^ -1 $, respectively. we derive the PDS~70b mass accretion rate to be $\gtrsim$~5~$\times$~10$^ -7 $~$M_ \rm Jup $~yr$^ -1 $.

Assuming a standard gas-to-dust ratio of 100, the ratio between the total mass of the circumplanetary disk and the mass of the central planet would be between 10<SUP>-4</SUP> and 10<SUP>-5</SUP>. Furthermore, we report the discovery of another compact continuum source located 0.″074 $\pm$ 0.″013 southwest of a second known planet in this system, PDS 70 b, that was previously detected in near-infrared images. We speculate that the latter source might trace dust orbiting in proximity of the planet, but more sensitive observations are required to unveil its nature.},

	abstract = {Context. PDS 70 is a young (5.4 Myr), nearby ( 113 pc) star hosting a known transition disk with a large gap. Recent observations with SPHERE and NACO in the near-infrared (NIR) allowed us to detect a planetary mass companion, PDS 70 b, within the disk cavity. Moreover, observations in H<SUB>α</SUB> with MagAO and MUSE revealed emission associated to PDS 70 b and to another new companion candidate, PDS 70 c, at a larger separation from the star. PDS 70 is the only multiple planetary system at its formation stage detected so far through direct imaging. <BR /> Aims: Our aim is to confirm the discovery of the second planet PDS 70 c using SPHERE at VLT, to further characterize its physical properties, and search for additional point sources in this young planetary system. <BR /> Methods: We re-analyzed archival SPHERE NIR observations and obtained new data in Y, J, H and K spectral bands for a total of four different epochs. The data were reduced using the data reduction and handling pipeline and the SPHERE data center. We then applied custom routines (e.g., ANDROMEDA and PACO) to subtract the starlight. <BR /> Results: We re-detect both PDS 70 b and c and confirm that PDS 70 c is gravitationally bound to the star. We estimate this second planet to be less massive than 5 M<SUB>Jup</SUB> and with a T<SUB>eff</SUB> around 900 K. Also, it has a low gravity with logg between 3.0 and 3.5 dex. In addition, a third object has been identified at short separation ( 0.12'') from the star and gravitationally bound to the star. Its spectrum is however very blue, meaning that we are probably seeing stellar light reflected by dust and our analysis seems to demonstrate that it is a feature of the inner disk. We cannot however completely exclude the possibility that it is a planetary mass object enshrouded by a dust envelope. In this latter case, its mass should be of the order of a few tens of M<SUB>⊕</SUB>. Moreover, we propose a possible structure for the planetary system based on our data, and find that this structure cannot be stable on a long timescale. <P />The reduced images are also available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr</A> (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via <A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/632/A25">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/632/A25</A> <P />Based on observation made with European Southern Observatory (ESO) telescopes at Paranal Observatory in Chile, under programs ID 095.C-0298(B), 1100.C-0481(D), 1100.C-0481(L) and 1100.C-0481(M).},

@article{Keppler2018,
	abstract = {Context. Young circumstellar disks are the birthplaces of planets. Their study is of prime interest to understand the physical and chemical conditions under which planet formation takes place. Only very few detections of planet candidates within these disks exist, and most of them are currently suspected to be disk features.  Aims: In this context, the transition disk around the young star PDS 70 is of particular interest, due to its large gap identified in previous observations, indicative of ongoing planet formation. We aim to search for the presence of an embedded young planet and search for disk structures that may be the result of disk-planet interactions and other evolutionary processes.  Methods: We analyse new and archival near-infrared images of the transition disk PDS 70 obtained with the VLT/SPHERE, VLT/NaCo, and Gemini/NICI instruments in polarimetric differential imaging and angular differential imaging modes.  Results: We detect a point source within the gap of the disk at about 195 mas ( 22 au) projected separation. The detection is confirmed at five different epochs, in three filter bands and using different instruments. The astrometry results in an object of bound nature, with high significance. The comparison of the measured magnitudes and colours to evolutionary tracks suggests that the detection is a companion of planetary mass. The luminosity of the detected object is consistent with that of an L-type dwarf, but its IR colours are redder, possibly indicating the presence of warm surrounding material. Further, we confirm the detection of a large gap of  54 au in size within the disk in our scattered light images, and detect a signal from an inner disk component. We find that its spatial extent is very likely smaller than  17 au in radius, and its position angle is consistent with that of the outer disk. The images of the outer disk show evidence of a complex azimuthal brightness distribution which is different at different wavelengths and may in part be explained by Rayleigh scattering from very small grains.  Conclusions: The detection of a young protoplanet within the gap of the transition disk around PDS 70 opens the door to a so far observationally unexplored parameter space of planetary formation and evolution. Future observations of this system at different wavelengths and continuing astrometry will allow us to test theoretical predictions regarding planet-disk interactions, planetary atmospheres, and evolutionary models.

	abstract = {We present ALMA 0.87 mm continuum, HCO+ J = 4-3 emission line, and CO J = 3-2 emission line data of the disk of material around the young, Sun-like star PDS 70. These data reveal the existence of a possible two-component transitional disk system with a radial dust gap of 0."42 $\pm$ 0."05, an azimuthal gap in the HCO+ J = 4-3 moment zero map, as well as two bridge-like features in the gas data. Interestingly these features in the gas disk have no analog in the dust disk making them of particular interest. We modeled the dust disk using the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code HOCHUNK3D using a two-disk component. We find that there is a radial gap that extends from 15 to 60 au in all grain sizes, which differs from previous work.},

@article{Muller2018,
	abstract = {Context. The observation of planets in their formation stage is a crucial but very challenging step in understanding when, how, and where planets form. PDS 70 is a young pre-main sequence star surrounded by a transition disk, in the gap of which a planetary-mass companion has recently been discovered. This discovery represents the first robust direct detection of such a young planet, possibly still at the stage of formation.  Aims: We aim to characterize the orbital and atmospheric properties of PDS 70 b, which was first identified on May 2015 in the course of the SHINE survey with SPHERE, the extreme adaptive-optics instrument at the VLT.  Methods: We obtained new deep SPHERE/IRDIS imaging and SPHERE/IFS spectroscopic observations of PDS 70 b. The astrometric baseline now covers 6 yr, which allowed us to perform an orbital analysis. For the first time, we present spectrophotometry of the young planet which covers almost the entire near-infrared range (0.96-3.8 mum). We use different atmospheric models covering a large parameter space in temperature, log g, chemical composition, and cloud properties to characterize the properties of the atmosphere of PDS 70 b.  Results: PDS 70 b is most likely orbiting the star on a circular and disk coplanar orbit at  22 au inside the gap of the disk. We find a range of models that can describe the spectrophotometric data reasonably well in the temperature range 1000-1600 K and log g no larger than 3.5 dex. The planet radius covers a relatively large range between 1.4 and 3.7 RJ with the larger radii being higher than expected from planet evolution models for the age of the planet of 5.4 Myr.  Conclusions: This study provides a comprehensive data set on the orbital motion of PDS 70 b, indicating a circular orbit and a motion coplanar with the disk. The first detailed spectral energy distribution of PDS 70 b indicates a temperature typical of young giant planets. The detailed atmospheric analysis indicates that a circumplanetary disk may contribute to the total planetflux.
