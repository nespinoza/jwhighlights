	abstract = {Array programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

              The origin of life on Earth would benefit from a prebiotic atmosphere that produced nitriles, like HCN, which enable ribonucleotide synthesis. However, geochemical evidence suggests that Hadean air was relatively oxidizing with negligible photochemical production of prebiotic molecules. These paradoxes are resolved by iron-rich asteroid impacts that transiently reduced the entire atmosphere, allowing nitriles to form in subsequent photochemistry. Here we investigate impact-generated reducing atmospheres using new time-dependent, coupled atmospheric chemistry and climate models that account for gas-phase reactions and surface catalysis.

	abstract = {Upcoming James Webb Space Telescope observations will allow us to study exoplanet and brown dwarf atmospheres in great detail. The physical interpretation of these upcoming high signal-to-noise observations requires precise atmospheric models of exoplanets and brown dwarfs. While several 1D and 3D atmospheric models have been developed in the past three decades, these models have often relied on simpliﬁed assumptions like chemical equilibrium and are also often not open-source, which limits their usage and development by the wider community. We present a Python-based 1Dl atmospheric radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE) model. This model has heritage from the Fortran-based code, which has been widely used to model the atmospheres of solar system objects, brown dwarfs, and exoplanets. In short, the basic capability of the original model is to compute the atmospheric state of the object under RCE given its effective or internal temperature, gravity, and host-star properties (if relevant). In the new model, which has been included within the well-utilized code-base PICASO, we have added these original features as well as the new capability of self-consistently treating disequilibrium chemistry. This code is widely applicable to hydrogen-dominated atmospheres (e.g., brown dwarfs and giant planets).},

The depletion is thought to be maintained by disequilibrium processes such as photochemistry or mixing from a hotter interior7,8,9. However, the interiors are largely unconstrained along with the vertical mixing strength and only upper limits on the CH4 depletion have been available. The warm Neptune WASP-107 b stands out among exoplanets with an unusually low density, reported low core mass10, and temperatures amenable to CH4 though previous observations have yet to find the molecule2,4. Here we present a JWST NIRSpec transmission spectrum of WASP-107 b which shows features from both SO2 and CH4 along with H2O, CO2, and CO. We detect methane with 4.2σ significance at an abundance of 1.0±0.5 ppm, which is depleted by 3 orders of magnitude relative to equilibrium expectations. Our results are highly constraining for the atmosphere and interior, which indicate the envelope has a super-solar metallicity of 43±8× solar, a hot interior with an intrinsic temperature of Tint=460±40 K, and vigorous vertical mixing which depletes CH4 with a diffusion coefficient of Kzz = 1011.6±0.1 cm2/s. Photochemistry has a negligible effect on the CH4 abundance, but is needed to account for the SO2.

It is located at the border of the Neptune desert, which describes the lack of highly irradiated Neptune-sized planets, and which remains poorly understood. Its large scale height and bright host star make the transiting WASP-127b a valuable target to characterise in transmission spectroscopy. We used combined EulerCam and TESS light curves to recalculate the system parameters. Additionally, we present an in-depth search for sodium in four transit observations of WASP-127b, obtained as part of the Hot Exoplanet Atmosphere Resolved with Transit Spectroscopy (HEARTS) survey with the High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) spectrograph. Two nights from this dataset were analysed independently by another team. The team claimed a detection of sodium that is incompatible with previous studies of data from both ground and space. We show that this strong sodium detection is due to contamination from telluric sodium emissions and the low signal-to-noise ratio in the core of the deep stellar sodium lines. When these effects are properly accounted for, the previous sodium signal is reduced to an absorption of 0.46 ± 0.20\% (2.3σ), which is compatible with analyses of WASP-127b transits carried out with other instruments. We can ﬁt a Gaussian to the D2 line, but the D1 line was not detected. This indicates an unusual line ratio if sodium exists in the atmosphere. Follow-up of WASP-127 at high resolution and with high sensitivity is required to ﬁrmly establish the presence of sodium and analyse its line shape.},

WASP-105b is a warm Jupiter (1.8 MJup, 0.96 RJup) in a 7.9-day orbit around a metal-rich K2 star. WASP-107b is a warm super-Neptune/sub-Saturn (0.12 MJup, 0.94 RJup) in a 5.7-day orbit around a solar-metallicity K6 star. Considering that giant planets seem to be more common around stars of higher metallicity and stars of higher mass, it is notable that the hosts are all metalrich, late-type stars. With orbital separations that place both WASP-105b and WASP-107b in the weak-tide regime, measurements of the alignment between the planets’ orbital axes and their stars’ spin axes may help us to understand the inward migration of shortperiod, giant planets. The mass of WASP-107b (2.2 MNep, 0.40 MSat) places it in the transition region between the ice giants and gas giants of the Solar System. Its radius of 0.94 RJup suggests that it is a low-mass gas giant with a H/He-dominated composition. The planet thus sets a lower limit of 2.2 MNep on the planetary mass above which large gaseous envelopes can be accreted and retained by proto-planets on their way to becoming gas giants. We may discover whether WASP-107b more closely resembles an ice giant or a gas giant by measuring its atmospheric metallicity via transmission spectroscopy, for which WASP-107b is a very good target.},

We ﬁrst reﬁne the orbital properties of WASP-121b, which is on a nearly polar (obliquity ψNorth=88.1±0.25◦ or ψSouth=91.11±0.20◦) orbit, and exclude a high diﬀerential rotation for its fastrotating (P{\textless}1.13 days), highly inclined (iNorth=8.1−+23..60◦ or iSouth=171.9−+32..45◦) star. We then present a new method that exploits the reloaded Rossiter-McLaughlin technique to separate the contribution of the planetary atmosphere and of the spectrum of the stellar surface along the transit chord. Its application to HARPS transit spectroscopy of WASP121b reveals the absorption signature from metals, likely atomic iron, in the planet atmospheric limb. The width of the signal (14.3±1.2 km s−1) can be explained by the rotation of the tidally locked planet. Its blueshift (-5.2±0.5 km s−1) could trace strong winds from the dayside to the nightside, or the anisotropic expansion of the planetary thermosphere.},

These radii are determined using only direct observables—the bolometric ﬂux at Earth, the effective temperature, and the parallax provided by the Gaia ﬁrst data release—and thus are virtually model independent, with extinction being the only free parameter. We also determine each star’s mass using our newly determined radius and the stellar density, a virtually model independent quantity itself from previously published transit analyses. These stellar radii and masses are in turn used to redetermine the transiting-planet radii and masses, again using only direct observables. The median uncertainties on the stellar radii and masses are 8\% and 30\%, respectively, and the resulting uncertainties on the planet radii and masses are 9\% and 22\%, respectively. These accuracies are generally larger than previously published model-dependent precisions of 5\% and 6\% on the planet radii and masses, respectively, but the newly determined values are purely empirical. We additionally report radii for 242 stars hosting radialvelocity (non-transiting) planets, with a median achieved accuracy of ≈2\%. Using our empirical stellar masses we verify that the majority of putative “retired A stars” in the sample are indeed more massive than ∼1.2M. Most importantly, the bolometric ﬂuxes and angular radii reported here for a total of 498 planet host stars—with median accuracies of 1.7\% and 1.8\%, respectively—serve as a fundamental data set to permit the re-determination of transiting-planet radii and masses with the Gaia second data release to ≈3\% and ≈5\% accuracy, better than currently published precisions, and determined in an entirely empirical fashion.},

	abstract = {Characterizing rocky exoplanets is a central endeavor of astronomy, and yet the search for atmospheres on rocky exoplanets has hitherto resulted in either tight upper limits on the atmospheric mass1–3 or inconclusive results4–6. The 1.95-REarth and 8.8-MEarth planet 55 Cnc e, with a predominantly rocky composition and an equilibrium temperature of {\textasciitilde}2000 K, may have a volatile envelope (containing molecules made from a combination of C, H, O, N, S, and P elements) that accounts for up to a few percent of its radius7–13. The planet has been observed extensively with transmission spectroscopy14–22, and its thermal emission has been measured in broad photometric bands23–26. These observations disfavor a primordial H2/He-dominated atmosphere but cannot conclusively determine whether the planet has a secondary atmosphere27,28. Here we report a thermal emission spectrum of the planet obtained by JWST’s NIRCam and MIRI instruments from 4 to 12 μm. The measurements rule out the scenario where the planet is a lava world shrouded by a tenuous atmosphere made of vaporized rock29–32, and indicate a bona fide volatile atmosphere likely rich in CO2 or CO. This atmosphere can be outgassed from and sustained by a magma ocean.},

	abstract = {Recent JWST eclipse spectra of the high-density hot Saturn HD 149026b between 2.35 and 5.08 μm has allowed for in-depth study of its atmosphere. To understand its atmospheric properties, we have created a grid of 1D radiative-convective-thermochemical equilibrium atmosphere models and spectra with PICASO 3.0. In agreement with previous work, we find that the presence of gaseous TiO creates a thermal inversion, which is inconsistent with the data. The presence of gaseous VO, however, which condenses at temperatures 200 K cooler, does not cause such inversions but alters the temperature–pressure profile of the atmosphere. We estimate an atmospheric metallicity of 14+–812× solar without VO and 20+–811× solar with VO, a factor of ∼ 10 times smaller than previous work from Bean et al. (2023), who relied on atmosphere retrievals. We attribute this significant difference in metallicity to a larger temperature gradient at low pressures in radiative equilibrium models. Such models with lower metallicities readily fit the strong CO2 feature at 4.3 μm. Our lower estimated metallicity makes HD 149026b more consistent with the mass-metallicity relationship for other giant planets. We find a C/O ratio of 0.67+–00..2076 with and without VO. The best-fit heat redistribution factor without VO is 1.17, a very high value suggesting very little dayside energy transport and no energy transport to the night side. The heat redistribution factor shrinks to a more plausible value of 0.91+–00.0.055, with VO, which we regard as circumstantial evidence for the molecule in the atmosphere of HD 149026b.},

	title = {Information content of {JWST} spectra of {WASP}-39b},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02656},
	abstract = {Methods. Two Bayesian inference methods are used to perform atmospheric retrievals: the standard nested sampling method, as well as the supervised machine learning method of the random forest (trained on a model grid). For nested sampling, Bayesian model comparison is used as a guide to identify the set of models with the required complexity to explain the data.
Results. Generally, non-isothermal transit chords are needed to fit the transmission spectra of WASP-39b, although the complexity of the temperature-pressure profile required is mode-dependent. The minimal set of chemical species needed to fit a spectrum is modedependent as well, and also depends on whether grey or non-grey clouds are assumed. When a non-grey cloud model is used to fit the NIRSpec G395H spectrum, it generates a spectral continuum that compensates for the water opacity. The same compensation is absent when fitting the non-grey cloud model to the NIRSpec PRISM spectrum (which has broader wavelength coverage), suggesting that it is spurious. The interplay between the cloud spectral continuum and the water opacity determines if sulphur dioxide is needed to fit either spectrum.
Conclusions. The inferred elemental abundances of carbon and oxygen and the carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratios are all mode- and model-dependent, and should be interpreted with caution. Bayesian model comparison does not always offer a clear path forward for favouring specific retrieval models (e.g. grey versus non-grey clouds) and thus for enabling unambiguous interpretations of exoplanet spectra.},

The dynamical time constant,tdyn, can be computed usingtdyn=L2/Keddy, whereLis a length scale andKeddyis the vertical eddy diffusion coefficient.

Here it is shown that an effective length scaleLeff, can be estimated from thee-folding length scales oftchemandtdynand the pressure dependence of the equilibrium value of the chemical abundance. The improved accuracy of usingL=Leffinstead ofL=His demonstrated by comparing the results of three different mathematical “models” for convective dynamics. The three models are the quench level approximation, a second computation that uses diffusive mixing to describe convection, and a third computation that explicitly integrates the equations of motion and chemical equilibration. Each of the three models uses a different fundamental quantity in describing the strength or efficiency of mixing that depends on the length scaleLin a different way. WhenL=His used, the three models give three different results, but whenL=Leffis used, results from the three models are virtually identical. The effective length scale,Leff, is different for different chemical reactions and can be far from a scale height. As an example, for the isotropic enrichment of (D/H) in CH4over (D/H) in H2, the effective length scale isLeff= 0.14Hat a typical value ofKeddy= 108cm2sec−1. UsingL= 0.14Hleads to an enrichment factor of 1.17 on Jupiter compared to 1.21 whenL=His used.},

	abstract = {The recent inference of sulfur dioxide (SO2) in the atmosphere of the hot (approximately 1,100 K), Saturn-mass exoplanet WASP-39b from near-infrared JWST observations1–3 suggests that photochemistry is a key process in high-temperature exoplanet atmospheres4. This is because of the low ({\textless}1 ppb) abundance of SO2 under thermochemical equilibrium compared with that produced from the photochemistry of H2O and H2S (1–10 ppm)4–9. However, the SO2 inference was made from a single, small molecular feature in the transmission spectrum of WASP-39b at 4.05 μm and, therefore, the detection of other SO2 absorption bands at different wavelengths is needed to better constrain the SO2 abundance. Here we report the detection of SO2 spectral features at 7.7 and 8.5 μm in the 5–12-μm transmission spectrum of WASP-39b measured by the JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) Low Resolution Spectrometer (LRS)10. Our observations suggest an abundance of SO2 of 0.5–25 ppm (1σ range), consistent with previous findings4. As well as SO2, we find broad water-vapour absorption features, as well as an unexplained decrease in the transit depth at wavelengths longer than 10 μm. Fitting the spectrum with a grid of atmospheric forward models, we derive an atmospheric heavy-element content (metallicity) for WASP-39b of approximately 7.1–8.0 times solar and demonstrate that photochemistry shapes the spectra of WASP-39b across a broad wavelength range.},

	abstract = {One of the primary questions when characterizing Earth-sized and super-Earth-sized exoplanets is whether they have a substantial atmosphere like Earth and Venus or a bare-rock surface like Mercury. Phase curves of the planets in thermal emission provide clues to this question, because a substantial atmosphere would transport heat more efﬁciently than a bare-rock surface. Analyzing phase-curve photometric data around secondary eclipses has previously been used to study energy transport in the atmospheres of hot Jupiters. Here we use phase curve, Spitzer time-series photometry to study the thermal emission properties of the super-Earth exoplanet 55 Cancri e. We utilize a semianalytical framework to ﬁt a physical model to the infrared photometric data at 4.5 μm. The model uses parameters of planetary properties including Bond albedo, heat redistribution efﬁciency (i.e., ratio between radiative timescale and advective timescale of the atmosphere), and the atmospheric greenhouse factor. The phase curve of 55 Cancri e is dominated by thermal emission with an eastward-shifted hotspot. We determine the heat redistribution efﬁciency to be 1.47-+00..2350, which implies that the advective timescale is on the same order as the radiative timescale. This requirement cannot be met by the bare-rock planet scenario because heat transport by currents of molten lava would be too slow. The phase curve thus favors the scenario with a substantial atmosphere. Our constraints on the heat redistribution efﬁciency translate to an atmospheric pressure of ∼1.4 bar. The Spitzer 4.5 μm band is thus a window into the deep atmosphere of the planet 55 Cancri e.},

Cloud properties are determined by the local thermodynamical and chemical conditions of an atmospheric gas. A retrieval of gas abundances requires a comprehension of the cloud formation mechanisms under varying chemical conditions. With the aim of studying cloud formation in metal-rich atmospheres, we explore the possibility of clouds in evaporating exoplanets like CoRoT-7b and 55 Cancri e (55 Cnc e) in comparison to a generic set of solar abundances and the metal-rich gas giant HD 149026b. We assess the impact of metal-rich, non-solar element abundances on the gas-phase chemistry, and apply our kinetic, non-equilibrium cloud formation model to study cloud structures and their details. We provide an overview of global cloud properties in terms of material compositions, maximum particle formation rates and average cloud particle sizes for various sets of rocky element abundances. Our results suggest that the conditions on 55 Cnc e and HD 149026b should allow the formation of mineral clouds in their atmosphere. The high temperatures on some hot rocky super-Earths (e.g. the day side of CoRoT-7b) result in an ionized atmospheric gas, and they prevent gas condensation, making cloud formation unlikely on its day side.},

	abstract = {Growing observational evidence has suggested active meteorology in the atmospheres of brown dwarfs (BDs) and directly imaged extrasolar giant planets (EGPs). In particular, a number of surveys have shown that near-infrared brightness variability is common among L and T dwarfs. Despite the likelihood from previous studies that atmospheric dynamics is the major cause of the variability, the detailed mechanism of the variability remains elusive, and we need to seek a natural, self-consistent mechanism. Clouds are important in shaping the thermal structure and spectral properties of these atmospheres via their opacity, and we expect the same for inducing atmospheric variability. In this work, using a time-dependent one-dimensional model that incorporates a selfconsistent coupling between the thermal structure, convective mixing, cloud radiative heating/cooling, and condensation/evaporation of clouds, we show that radiative cloud feedback can drive spontaneous atmospheric variability in both temperature and cloud structure under conditions appropriate for BDs and directly imaged EGPs. The typical periods of variability are 1 to tens of hr, with a typical amplitude of the variability up to hundreds of K in effective temperature. The existence of variability is robust over a wide range of parameter space, but the detailed evolution of the variability is sensitive to model parameters. Our novel, self-consistent mechanism has important implications for the observed ﬂux variability of BDs and directly imaged EGPs, especially for objects whose variability evolves on short timescales. It is also a promising mechanism for cloud breaking, which has been proposed to explain the L/T transition of BDs.},

	abstract = {The nearby hot super-Earth planet 55 Cancri e shows variable occultation depths, i.e. variable amounts of dayside emission. The origin of these variations could lie in several phenomena, intrinsically dependent on the planetary atmospheric properties or surface features. We aim to identify the origin of this variation, and specifically test whether it originates from different sides of the planet being visible due to a 3:2 spin-orbit resonance. Even for an atmosphereless "bare rock", this asynchronous rotation would produce a magma pool and mineral vapors over the day side that depend on the local surface conditions, giving rise to variability. If the surface is dominated by silicates, as is likely for a hot rocky planet, the extreme temperatures of the day side would produce detectable amounts of SiO gas from the vaporization of SiO2 in the morning that subsequently rains out and recrystallizes back to SiO2 in the evening. If the planet is in a 3:2 spin-orbit resonance, every second occultation would show the same face of the planet with the emission highly correlated. The planet could also be covered by a massive atmosphere that provides the thermal inertia, even in the case that the variability is unrelated to asynchronous rotation, to explain the observed redistribution of heat. Spectral features, potentially variable, may then be detected. We thus aim to answer the following questions: 1) Is there a massive atmosphere or is it essentially a bare rock with vaporized SiO? 2) If a bare rock, can the variability be explained by asynchronous rotation? This will help us understand the origin and nature of hot super-Earths, of which 55 Cnc e is the best representative.},

	abstract = {The naked-eye star 55 Cancri hosts a planetary system with ﬁve known planets, including a hot super-Earth (55 Cnc e) extremely close to its star and a farther out giant planet (55 Cnc b), found in milder irradiation conditions with respect to other known hot Jupiters. This system raises important questions on the evolution of atmospheres for close-in exoplanets, and the dependence with planetary mass and irradiation. These questions can be addressed by Lyman-α transit observations of the extended hydrogen planetary atmospheres, complemented by contemporaneous measurements of the stellar X-ray ﬂux. In fact, planet “e” has been detected in transit, suggesting the system is seen nearly edge-on. Yet, planet “b” has not been observed in transit so far. Here, we report on Hubble Space Telescope STIS Lyα and Chandra ACIS-S X-ray observations of 55 Cnc. These simultaneous observations cover two transits of 55 Cnc e and two inferior conjunctions of 55 Cnc b. They reveal the star as a bright Lyα target and a variable X-ray source. While no signiﬁcant signal is detected during the transits of 55 Cnc e, we detect a surprising Lyα absorption of 7.5 ± 1.8\% (4.2σ) at inferior conjunctions of 55 Cnc b. The absorption is only detected over the range of Doppler velocities where the stellar radiation repels hydrogen atoms towards the observer. We calculate a false-alarm probability of 4.4\%, which takes the a-priori unknown transit parameters into account. This result suggests the possibility that 55 Cnc b has an extended upper H  atmosphere, which undergoes partial transits when the planet grazes the stellar disc. If conﬁrmed, it would show that planets cooler than hot Jupiters can also have extended atmospheres.},

	abstract = {We present high-resolution near-infrared spectra taken during eight transits of 55 Cancri e, a nearby low-density super-Earth with a short orbital period ({\textless}18 hr). While this exoplanet’s bulk density indicates a possible atmosphere, one has not been detected deﬁnitively. Our analysis relies on the Doppler cross-correlation technique, which takes advantage of the high spectral resolution and broad wavelength coverage of our data, to search for the thousands of absorption features from hydrogen-, carbon-, and nitrogen-rich molecular species in the planetary atmosphere. Although we are unable to detect an atmosphere around 55 Cancri e, we do place strong constraints on the levels of HCN, NH3, and C2H2 that may be present. In particular, at a mean molecular weight of 5 amu, we can rule out the presence of HCN in the atmosphere down to a volume mixing ratio (VMR) of 0.02\%, NH3 down to a VMR of 0.08\%, and C2H2 down to a VMR of 1.0\%. If the mean molecular weight is relaxed to 2 amu, we can rule out the presence of HCN, NH3, and C2H2 down to VMRs of 0.001\%, 0.0025\%, and 0.08\%, respectively. Our results reduce the parameter space of possible atmospheres consistent with the analysis of Hubble Space Telescope/WFC3 observations by Tsiaras et al. and indicate that if 55 Cancri e harbors an atmosphere, it must have a high mean molecular weight or clouds.},

The phase curve has a high amplitude and peak offset, suggesting that it has a signiﬁcant eastward hot-spot shift as well as a large day–night temperature contrast. We use a general circulation model to model potential climates, and investigate the relation between bulk atmospheric composition and the magnitude of these seemingly contradictory features. We conﬁrm theoretical models of tidally locked circulation are consistent with our numerical model of 55 Cnc e, and rule out certain atmospheric compositions based on their thermodynamic properties. Our best-ﬁtting atmosphere has a signiﬁcant hot-spot shift and day–night contrast, although these are not as large as the observed phase curve. We discuss possible physical processes that could explain the observations, and show that night-side cloud formation from species such as SiO from a day-side magma ocean could potentially increase the phase curve amplitude and explain the observations. We conclude that the observations could be explained by an optically thick atmosphere with a low mean molecular weight, a surface pressure of several bars, and a strong eastward circulation, with nightside cloud formation a possible explanation for the difference between our model and the observations.},

	abstract = {The ultra-short-period super-Earth 55 Cancri e has a measured radius of 1.88 Earth radii. Previous thermal phase curve observations suggest a strong temperature contrast between the dayside and nightside of around 1000 K; the hottest point is shifted 41 ± 12 degrees east from the substellar point, indicating some degree of heat circulation. The dayside (and potentially even the nightside) is hot enough to harbour a magma ocean. We used results from general circulation models (GCMs) of atmospheres to constrain the surface temperature contrasts. There is still a large uncertainty on the vigour and style of mantle convection in super-Earths, especially those that experience stellar irradiation high enough to harbour a magma ocean. In this work our aim is to constrain the mantle dynamics of the tidally locked lava world 55 Cancri e. Using the surface temperature contrasts as a boundary condition, we model the mantle flow of 55 Cancri e using 2D mantle convection simulations, and investigate how the convection regimes are affected by the different climate models. We find that large super-plumes form on the dayside if that hemisphere is covered by a magma ocean and the nightside remains solid or only partially molten. Cold material descends into the deep interior on the nightside, but no strong downwellings form. In some cases the super-plume also moves several tens of degrees towards the terminator. A convective regime where the upwelling is preferentially on the dayside might lead to preferential outgassing on that hemisphere which could lead to the build-up of atmospheric species that could be chemically distinct from the nightside.},

Numerous efforts to observe spectra of super-Earths, exoplanets with masses of 1–10 Earth masses, have thus far revealed only featureless spectra. In this paper, we report a 4σ detection of variability in the dayside thermal emission from the transiting super-Earth 55 Cancri e. Dedicated space-based monitoring of the planet in the mid-infrared over eight eclipses revealed the thermal emission from its dayside atmosphere varying by a factor of 3.7 between 2012 and 2013. The amplitude and trend of the variability are not explained by potential inﬂuence of star spots or by local thermal or compositional changes in the atmosphere over the short span of the observations. The possibility of largescale surface activity due to strong tidal interactions possibly similar to Io, or the presence of circumstellar/circumplanetary material appear plausible and motivate future long-term monitoring of the planet.},

Results. We detected a phase variation with a full-amplitude of 72 ± 7 ppm, but did not detect a signiﬁcant secondary eclipse of the planet. The shape of the phase variation resembles that of a piecewise-Lambertian; however, the non-detection of the planetary secondary eclipse, and the large amplitude of the variations exclude reﬂection from the planetary surface as a possible origin of the observed phase variations. They are also likely incompatible with magnetospheric interactions between the star and planet, but may imply that circumplanetary or circumstellar material modulate the ﬂux of the system.
Conclusions. This year, further precision photometry of 55 Cnc from CHEOPS will measure variations in the phase curve amplitude and shape over time.},

	abstract = {Ice-rich planets are formed exterior to the water ice line and thus are expected to contain a substantial amount of ice. The high ice content leads to unique conditions in the interior, under which the structure of a planet is affected by ice interaction with other metals. We apply experimental data of ice–rock interaction at high pressure, and calculate detailed thermal evolution for possible interior conﬁgurations of ice-rich planets, in the mass range of super-Earth to Neptunes (5–15 M⊕). We model the effect of migration inward on the ice-rich interior by including the inﬂuences of stellar ﬂux and envelope mass loss. We ﬁnd that ice and rock are expected to remain mixed, due to miscibility at high pressure, in substantial parts of the planetary interior for billions of years. We also ﬁnd that the deep interior of planetary twins that have migrated to different distances from the star are usually similar, if no mass loss occurs. Signiﬁcant mass loss results in separation of the water from the rock on the surface and emergence of a volatile atmosphere of less than 1\% of the planet’s mass. The mass of the atmosphere of water/ steam is limited by the ice–rock interaction. We conclude that when ice is abundant in planetary interiors the planet structure may differ signiﬁcantly from the standard layered structure of a water shell on top of a rocky core. Similar structure is expected in both close-in and further-out planets.},

Studies of exoplanets provide a useful context for elucidating the source of these chemical traits. Planet formation and evolution models demonstrate that rocky exoplanets commonly formed with hydrogen-rich envelopes that were lost over time1. These findings suggest that Earth may also have formed from bodies with hydrogen-rich primary atmospheres. Here we use a self-consistent thermodynamic model to show that Earth’s water, core density and overall oxidation state can all be sourced to equilibrium between hydrogen-rich primary atmospheres and underlying magma oceans in its progenitor planetary embryos. Water is produced from dry starting materials resembling enstatite chondrites as oxygen from magma oceans reacts with hydrogen. Hydrogen derived from the atmosphere enters the magma ocean and eventually the metal core at equilibrium, causing metal density deficits matching that of Earth. Oxidation of the silicate rocks from solar-like to Earth-like oxygen fugacities also ensues as silicon, along with hydrogen and oxygen, alloys with iron in the cores. Reaction with hydrogen atmospheres and metal–silicate equilibrium thus provides a simple explanation for fundamental features of Earth’s geochemistry that is consistent with rocky planet formation across the Galaxy.},

Here we present an advanced interior model for water-rich rocky exoplanets. The new model allows us to test the effects of rock melting and the redistribution of water between magma ocean and atmosphere on calculated planet radii. Models with and without rock melting and water partitioning lead to deviations in planet radius of up to 16\% for a ﬁxed bulk composition and planet mass. This is within the current accuracy limits for individual systems and statistically testable on a population level.

We identify a pathway by which 1–1.7 R⊕ (1–10 M⊕) rocky exoplanets with orbital periods of 10–100 days can acquire long-lived 10–2000 bar atmospheres that are H2O-dominated, with mean molecular weight {\textgreater}10. These atmospheres form during the planets’ evolution from sub-Neptunes into rocky exoplanets. H2O that is made by reduction of iron oxides in the silicate magma is highly soluble in the magma, forming a dissolved reservoir that is protected from loss so long as the H2-dominated atmosphere persists. The large size of the dissolved reservoir buffers the H2O atmosphere against loss after the H2 has dispersed. Within our model, a long-lived, water-dominated atmosphere is a common outcome for efﬁcient interaction between a nebuladerived atmosphere (peak atmosphere mass fraction 0.1–0.6 wt\%) and oxidized magma ({\textgreater}5 wt\% FeO), followed by atmospheric loss. This idea predicts that most rocky planets that have orbital periods of 10–100 days and that have radii within 0.1–0.2 R⊕ of the lower edge of the radius valley still retain H2O atmospheres. This prediction is imminently testable with James Webb Space Telescope and has implications for the interpretation of data for transiting super-Earths.},

Accounting for this cycle in our velocimetric analysis of the system allows us to revise the properties of the outermost giant planet and its four planetary companions. The innermost planet 55 Cnc e is an unusually close-in super-Earth, whose transits have allowed for detailed follow-up studies. Recent observations favor the presence of a substantial atmosphere yet its composition, and the nature of the planet, remain unknown. We combined our derived planet mass (Mp = 8.0 ± 0.3 MEarth) with reﬁned measurement of its optical radius derived from HST/STIS observations (Rp = 1.88 ± 0.03 REarth over 530–750 nm) to revise the density of 55 Cnc e (ρ = 6.7 ± 0.4 g cm−3). Based on these revised properties we have characterized possible interiors of 55 Cnc e using a generalized Bayesian model. We conﬁrm that the planet is likely surrounded by a heavyweight atmosphere, contributing a few percents of the planet radius. While we cannot exclude the presence of a water layer underneath the atmosphere, this scenario is unlikely given the observations of the planet across the entire spectrum and its strong irradiation. Follow-up observations of the system in photometry and in spectroscopy over different time-scales are needed to further investigate the nature and origin of this iconic super-Earth.},

	abstract = {Recently, the ﬁrst JWST measurement of thermal emission from a rocky exoplanet was reported. The inferred dayside brightness temperature of TRAPPIST-1 b at 15 μm is consistent with the planet having no atmosphere and therefore no mechanism by which to circulate heat to its nightside. In this Letter, we compare TRAPPIST-1 bʼs measured secondary eclipse depth to predictions from a suite of self-consistent radiative-convective equilibrium models in order to quantify the maximum atmospheric thickness consistent with the observation. We ﬁnd that plausible atmospheres (i.e., those that contain at least 100 ppm CO2) with surface pressures greater than 0.3 bar are ruled out at 3σ, regardless of the choice of background atmosphere, and a Mars-like thin atmosphere with surface pressure 6.5 mbar composed entirely of CO2 is also ruled out at 3σ. Thicker atmospheres of up to 10 bar (100 bar) are consistent with the data at 1σ (3σ) only if the atmosphere lacks any strong absorbers across the mid-IR wavelength range—a scenario that we deem unlikely. We additionally model the emission spectra for bare-rock planets of various compositions. We ﬁnd that a basaltic, metal-rich, and Fe-oxidized surface best matches the measured eclipse depth to within 1σ, and the best-ﬁt gray albedo is 0.02 ± 0.11. We conclude that planned secondary eclipse observations at 12.8 μm will serve to validate TRAPPIST-1 bʼs high observed brightness temperature, but are unlikely to further distinguish among the consistent atmospheric and bare-rock scenarios.},

However, it is still unknown whether such planets orbiting close to M dwarf stars can retain their atmospheres, or whether high-energy irradiation from the star will strip the gaseous envelopes from these objects. We present a new method to detect an atmosphere on a synchronously rotating rocky exoplanet around a K/M dwarf, by using thermal emission during secondary eclipse to infer a high dayside albedo that could only be explained by bright clouds. Based on calculations for plausible surface conditions, we conclude that a high albedo could be unambiguously interpreted as a signal of an atmosphere for planets with substellar temperatures of Tsub=410–1250 K. This range corresponds to equilibrium temperatures of Teq=300–880 K. We compare the inferred albedos of eight possible planet surface compositions to cloud albedo calculations. We determine that a layer of clouds with optical depths greater than τ=0.5–7, would have high enough albedos to be distinguishable from a bare rock surface. This method of detecting an atmosphere on a rocky planet is complementary to existing methods for detecting atmospheres, because it provides a way to detect atmospheres with pressures below 1bar (e.g., Mars), which are too tenuous to transport signiﬁcant heat but thick enough to host high-albedo clouds.},

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) might be able to settle this question empirically, but most proposals for doing so require large observational effort because they are based on spectroscopy. Here we show that infrared photometry of secondary eclipses could quickly identify “candidate” atmospheres, by searching for rocky planets with atmospheres thick enough that atmospheric heat transport noticeably reduces their dayside thermal emission compared to that of a bare rock. For a planet amenable to atmospheric follow-up, we ﬁnd that JWST should be able to conﬁdently detect the heat redistribution signal of an (1) bar atmosphere with one to two eclipses. One to two eclipses is generally much less than the effort needed to infer an atmosphere via transmission or emission spectroscopy. Candidate atmospheres can be further validated via follow-up spectroscopy or phase curves. In addition, because this technique is fast it could enable a ﬁrst atmospheric survey of rocky exoplanets with JWST. We estimate that the TESS mission will ﬁnd ∼100 planets that are too hot to be habitable but that can be quickly probed via eclipse photometry. Knowing whether hot, rocky planets around M dwarfs have atmospheres is important not only for understanding the evolution of uninhabitable worlds: if atmospheres are common on hot planets, then cooler, potentially habitable planets around M dwarfs are also likely to have atmospheres.},

For planets 10 M⊕, we ﬁnd that sub-Neptunes retain atmospheric mass fractions that scale with planet mass and show that the resulting mass–radius relations are degenerate with results for “water worlds” consisting of a 1:1 silicate-to-ice composition ratio. We further demonstrate that our derived mass–radius relation is in excellent agreement with the observed exoplanet population orbiting M dwarfs and that planet mass and radii alone are insufﬁcient to determine the composition of some subNeptunes. Finally, we highlight that current exoplanet demographics show an increase in the ratio of super-Earths to sub-Neptunes with both stellar mass (and therefore luminosity) and age, which are both indicative of thermally driven atmospheric escape processes.

We consider three possible origins for the gas layer on GJ 1214b: direct accretion of gas from the protoplanetary nebula, sublimation of ices, and outgassing from rocky material. Armed only with measurements of the planet mass (Mp = 6.55 ± 0.98 M⊕), radius (Rp = 2.678 ± 0.13 R⊕), and stellar irradiation level, our main conclusion is that we cannot infer a unique composition. A diverse range of planet interiors ﬁts the measured planet properties. Nonetheless, GJ 1214b’s relatively low average density (ρp = 1870 ± 400 kg m−3) means that it almost certainly has a signiﬁcant gas component. Our second major conclusion is that under most conditions we consider GJ 1214b would not have liquid water. Even if the outer envelope is predominantly sublimated water ice, the envelope will likely consist of a super-ﬂuid layer sandwiched between vapor above and plasma (electrically conductive ﬂuid) below at greater depths. In our models, a low intrinsic planet luminosity ( 2TW) is needed for a water envelope on GJ 1214b to pass through the liquid phase.},

Any explanation needs to account for the observed variability of its secondary eclipse depth, which is at times consistent with zero in the visible/optical range of wavelengths—a phenomenon that does not occur with its also variable infrared eclipses. Yet despite this variability, its transit depth remains somewhat constant in time and is inconsistent with opaque material ﬁlling its Hill sphere. The current study explores the possibility of a thin, transient, secondary atmosphere on 55 Cancri e that is sourced by geochemical outgassing. Its transient nature derives from the inability of outgassing to be balanced by atmospheric escape. As the outgassed atmosphere escapes and is replenished, it rapidly adjusts to radiative equilibrium and the temperature ﬂuctuations cause the infrared eclipse depths to vary. Atmospheres of pure carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide produce sufﬁcient Rayleigh scattering to explain the observed optical/visible eclipse depths, which vanish in the absence of an atmosphere and the presence of a dark rocky surface. Atmospheres of pure methane are ruled out, because they produce insufﬁcient Rayleigh scattering. Upcoming observations by the James Webb Space Telescope will potentially allow the atmospheric temperature and surface pressure, as well as the surface temperature, to be measured.},

The eclipses are best modeled by a year-to-year variability model, but variability on shorter timescales cannot be ruled out. The derived range of brightness temperatures can be achieved by a dark planet with inefficient heat redistribution intermittently covered over a large fraction of the substellar hemisphere by reflective grains, possibly indicating volcanic activity or cloud variability.

Based on these observations, we investigated the different processes that could be at the origin of the observed modulation. In particular, we built a toy model to assess whether a circumstellar torus of dust driven by radiation pressure and gravity might match the observed flux variability timescale.
Results. We find that the phase-curve amplitude and peak offset of 55 Cnc e do vary between visits. The sublimation timescales of selected dust species reveal that silicates expected in an Earth-like mantle would not survive long enough to explain the observed phasecurve modulation. We find that silicon carbide, quartz, and graphite are plausible candidates for the circumstellar torus composition because their sublimation timescales are long.
Conclusions. The extensive CHEOPS observations confirm that the phase-curve amplitude and offset vary in time. We find that dust could provide the grey opacity source required to match the observations. However, the data at hand do not provide evidence that circumstellar material with a variable grain mass per unit area causes the observed variability.

Given the brightness of 55 Cancri, the observations were obtained in scanning mode, adopting a very long scanning length and a very high scanning speed. We use our specialized pipeline to take into account systematics introduced by these observational parameters when coupled with the geometrical distortions of the instrument. We measure the transit depth per wavelength channel with an average relative uncertainty of 22 ppm per visit and ﬁnd modulations that depart from a straight line model with a 6σ conﬁdence level. These results suggest that 55 Cancri e is surrounded by an atmosphere, which is probably hydrogen-rich. Our fully Bayesian spectral retrieval code,  -REx, has identiﬁed HCN to be the most likely molecular candidate able to explain the features at 1.42 and 1.54 μm. While additional spectroscopic observations in a broader wavelength range in the infrared will be needed to conﬁrm the HCN detection, we discuss here the implications of such a result. Our chemical model, developed with combustion specialists, indicates that relatively high mixing ratios of HCN may be caused by a high C/O ratio.

In a later stage, we used the leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation statistic to compare with a model of constant occultation for the complete set and a model with no occultation.
Results. We report an occultation depth of 8 ± 2.5 ppm for the complete set of TESS observations. In particular, we measured a depth of 15 ± 4 ppm for sector 21, while for sector 44 we detected no occultation. In sector 46 we measured a weak occultation of 8 ± 5 ppm. The occultation depth varies from one sector to the next between 1.6 and 3.4 σ signiﬁcance. We derived the possible contribution on reﬂected light and thermal emission and set an upper limit on the geometric albedo. Based on our model comparison, the presence of an occultation is favoured considerably over no occultation, and the model with varying occultation across sectors takes most of the statistical weight.
Conclusions. Our analysis conﬁrms a detection of the occultation in TESS. Moreover, our results weakly lean towards a varying occultation depth between each sector, while the transit depth is constant across visits.},

	abstract = {The JWST has ushered in a new era in atmospheric characterisations of temperate low-mass exoplanets with recent detections of carbon-bearing molecules in the candidate Hycean world K2-18 b. We investigated JWST observations of the TOI-270 system, with two sub-Neptunes simultaneously transiting the nearby M dwarf during the visit. We report our atmospheric characterisation of the outer planet TOI-270 d, a candidate Hycean world, with JWST transmission spectroscopy using the NIRSpec G395H instrument in the 2.7-5.2 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m range, combined with previous observations obtained with the HST WFC3 spectrograph (1.1-1.6 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m). The spectrum reveals strong signatures of CH4 and CO2 at 3.8-4.9\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ and 2.9-3.9\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ confidence, respectively, and no evidence of NH3. The abundant CH4 and CO2, at {\textasciitilde}0.1-1\% mixing ratios, and the non-detection of NH3 are similar to the findings reported for K2-18 b and consistent with predictions for a Hycean world with a planet-wide ocean under a H2-rich atmosphere. We also report evidence of CS2 at a 2.3-3.0\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ confidence and a potential inference of H2O at 1.6-4.4\${\textbackslash}sigma\$, depending on the data analysis approach, and discuss possible interpretations of these results. The spectrum does not provide strong constraints on the presence of clouds or hazes in the observable atmosphere, nor any evidence for the effects of stellar heterogeneities, which is consistent with previous studies. For the smaller inner planet TOI-270 b, we find that the spectrum is inconsistent with a featureless spectrum at {\textasciitilde}3\${\textbackslash}sigma\$, showing some preference for an H2-rich atmosphere in a super-Earth. We discuss the implications of our findings and future prospects.},

	abstract = {The PLATO mission is scheduled for launch in 2026. This study aims to estimate the number of exoplanets that PLATO can detect as a function of planetary size and period, stellar brightness, and observing strategy options. Deviations from these estimates will be informative of the true occurrence rates of planets, which helps constraining planet formation models. For this purpose, we developed the Planet Yield for PLATO estimator (PYPE), which adopts a statistical approach. We apply given occurrence rates from planet formation models and from different search and vetting pipelines for the Kepler data. We estimate the stellar sample to be observed by PLATO using a fraction of the all-sky PLATO stellar input catalog (PIC). PLATO detection efficiencies are calculated under different assumptions that are presented in detail in the text. The results presented here primarily consider the current baseline observing duration of four years. We find that the expected PLATO planet yield increases rapidly over the first year and begins to saturate after two years. A nominal (2+2) four-year mission could yield about several thousand to several tens of thousands of planets, depending on the assumed planet occurrence rates. We estimate a minimum of 500 Earth-size (0.8-1.25 RE) planets, about a dozen of which would reside in a 250-500d period bin around G stars. We find that one-third of the detected planets are around stars bright enough (V \${\textbackslash}leq 11\$) for RV-follow-up observations. We find that a three-year-long observation followed by 6 two-month short observations (3+1 years) yield roughly twice as many planets as two long observations of two years (2+2 years). The former strategy is dominated by short-period planets, while the latter is more beneficial for detecting earths in the habitable zone.},

	abstract = {While it is well-established that giant-planet occurrence rises rapidly with host star metallicity, it is not yet clear if small-planet occurrence around late-type dwarf stars depends on host star metallicity. Using the Kepler Data Release 25 planet candidate list and its completeness data products, we explore planet occurrence as a function of metallicity in the Kepler field's late-type dwarf stellar population. We find that planet occurrence increases with metallicity for all planet radii Rp down to at least Rp ≈ 2 R⊕, and that in the range 2 R⊕ ≲ Rp ≲ 5 R⊕, planet occurrence scales linearly with metallicity Z. Extrapolating our results, we predict that short-period planets with Rp ≲ 2 R⊕ should be rare around early-M dwarf stars with [M/H] ≲ -0.5 or late-M dwarf stars with [M/H] ≲ +0.0. This dependence of planet occurrence on metallicity observed in the Kepler field emphasizes the need to control for metallicity in estimates of planet occurrence for late-type dwarf stars like those targeted by Kepler's K2 extension and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. We confirm the theoretical expectation that the small-planet occurrence-host star metallicity relation is stronger for low-mass stars than for solar-type stars. We establish that the expected solid mass in planets around late-type dwarfs in the Kepler field is comparable to the total amount of planet-making solids in their protoplanetary disks. We argue that this high efficiency of planet formation favors planetesimal accretion over pebble accretion as the origin of the small planets observed by Kepler around late-type dwarf stars.},

Results. We ﬁnd strong evidence for a planet-metallicity correlation among the secure planet hosts of our giant star sample, in agreement with the one for main-sequence stars. However, the planet-metallicity correlation is absent for our sample of planet candidates, raising the suspicion that a good fraction of them might indeed not be planets despite clear periodicities in the radial velocities. Consistent with the literature results for subgiants, the giant planet occurrence rate increases in the stellar mass interval from 1 to 1.9 M . However, there is a maximum at a stellar mass of 1.9+−00..15 M , and the occurrence rate drops rapidly for masses larger than 2.5–3.0 M . We do not ﬁnd any planets around stars more massive than 2.7 M , although there are 113 stars with masses between 2.7 and 5 M in our sample (corresponding to a giant planet occurrence rate smaller than 1.6\% at 68.3\% conﬁdence in that stellar mass bin). We also show that this result is not a selection eﬀect related to the planet detectability being a function of the stellar mass.
Conclusions. We conclude that giant planet formation or inward migration is suppressed around higher mass stars, possibly because of faster disk depletion coupled with a longer migration timescale.},

Together with similar correlations with bulge luminosity and mass, this led to the widespread belief that BHs and bulges coevolve by regulating each other's growth. Conclusions based on one set of correlations from in brightest cluster ellipticals to in the smallest galaxies dominated BH work for more than a decade. New results are now replacing this simple story with a richer and more plausible picture in which BHs correlate differently with different galaxy components. A reasonable aim is to use this progress to refine our understanding of BH-galaxy coevolution. BHs with masses of 105−106M⊙ are found in many bulgeless galaxies. Therefore, classical (elliptical-galaxy-like) bulges are not necessary for BH formation. On the other hand, although they live in galaxy disks, BHs do not correlate with galaxy disks. Also, any correlations with the properties of disk-grown pseudobulges and dark matter halos are weak enough to imply no close coevolution. The above and other correlations of host-galaxy parameters with each other and with suggest that there are four regimes of BH feedback. (1) Local, secular, episodic, and stochastic feeding of small BHs in largely bulgeless galaxies involves too little energy to result in coevolution. (2) Global feeding in major, wet galaxy mergers rapidly grows giant BHs in short-duration, quasar-like events whose energy feedback does affect galaxy evolution. The resulting hosts are classical bulges and coreless-rotating-disky ellipticals. (3) After these AGN phases and at the highest galaxy masses, maintenance-mode BH feedback into X-ray-emitting gas has the primarily negative effect of helping to keep baryons locked up in hot gas and thereby keeping galaxy formation from going to completion. This happens in giant, core-nonrotating-boxy ellipticals. Their properties, including their tight correlations between and core parameters, support the conclusion that core ellipticals form by dissipationless major mergers. They inherit coevolution effects from smaller progenitor galaxies. Also, (4) independent of any feedback physics, in BH growth modes 2 and 3, the averaging that results from successive mergers plays a major role in decreasing the scatter in correlations from the large values observed in bulgeless and pseudobulge galaxies to the small values observed in giant elliptical galaxies.},

Such a relation is first sought in nearby calibration galaxies of the Local Group, the M 81 group, and the M 101 group, with well-determined distances, accurately known photometric properties, and accurately known global hydrogen profile width. On the basis of these calibration magnitude-global profile width and diameter-global profile width relationships, distances were derived for the Virgo cluster and the Ursa Major cluster. The distance moduli obtained are 30.6 m for the Virgo cluster and 30.5 m for the Ursa Major cluster. The result for the Virgo cluster suggests a Hubble constant of 80 km per sec per Mpc.},

	abstract = {The intrinsic rate of natural increase, \${\textbackslash}text\{r\}\_\{m\}\$, was calculated for 44 mammalian species using the Cole (1954) equation and life history data from the literature. Values of rm so calculated were plotted as \${\textbackslash}text\{log\}\_\{10\}{\textbackslash} r\_\{m\}\$ versus log10 body mass revealing a linear relationship with a slope of -0.2622. The equation of the regression line fitting these data was then used to correct rm for body mass so that interspecific comparisons with respect to rm and basal metabolic rate could be made to determine if a positive relationship exists between these two parameters. Basal metabolic rate correlates positively with rm, and apparently is one of many factors operating in the evolution of rm. Implications of these conclusions with respect to food habits, resource limitations, and the possible existence of a trade-off between maintenance and reproduction in certain environments is discussed. If one assumes that all mammals face environmental limits on the amount of energy available for maintenance, growth, and reproduction, it follows that any reduction in maintenance costs should provide more energy for growth and/or reproduction. The proposed existence of such a trade-off between maintenance and reproduction was a major premise upon which MacArthur and Wilson (1967) based their concept of "r- and K-selection". Recently, however, McNab (1980) has suggested that for mammals that reproduce when food is not limiting, an increase in one maintenace cost, i.e. basal metabolic rate, may not detract from but may actually increase the intrinsic rate of natural increase, rm. Although this idea may seem counterintuitive, if one assumes an unlimited amount of energy, the factor limiting growth and reproduction will be the rate at which the energy can be used; a higher metabolic rate will mean a higher rate of biosynthesis, a faster growth rate, a shorter generation time, and hence a higher rm. Since some animal species appear not to be food-limited during their reproductive seasons (Armitage and Down-hower 1974; Millar 1977; Rabenold 1979), natural selection may favor maximization of metabolic rate as a means of maximizing rm in these species. If these hypotheses concerning the correlation between basal metabolic rate and rm are correct, a comparison of mammalian species with respect to basal metabolic rate and rm should reveal a positive relationship between these two parameters.},

We find that both the east and west limb often form clouds, but that the different properties of these clouds enhances the limb to limb differences compared to the clear case. Using JWST it should be possible to detect the presence of cloud inhomogeneities by comparing the shape of the transit lightcurve at multiple wavelengths because inhomogeneous clouds impart a characteristic, wavelength dependent signature. This method is statistically robust even with limited wavelength coverage, uncertainty on limb darkening coefficients, and imprecise transit times. We predict that the short wavelength slope varies strongly with temperature. The hot limb of the hottest planets form higher altitude clouds composed of smaller particles leading to a strong rayleigh slope. The near infrared spectral features of clouds are almost always detectable, even when no spectral slope is visible in the optical. In some of our models a spectral window between 5 and 9 microns can be used to probe through the clouds and detect chemical spectral features. Our cloud particle size distributions are not log-normal and differ from species to species. Using the area or mass weighted particle size significantly alters the relative strength of the cloud spectral features compared to using the predicted size distribution. Finally, the cloud content of a given planet is sensitive to a species' desorption energy and contact angle, two parameters that could be constrained experimentally in the future.},

We present a "chain" of models, linking the formation of a planet to its observable present-day spectrum. The chain links include (1) the planet's formation and migration, (2) its long-term thermodynamic evolution, (3) a variety of disk chemistry models, (4) a non-gray atmospheric model, and (5) a radiometric model to obtain simulated spectroscopic observations with JWST and ARIEL. In our standard chemistry model the inner disk is depleted in refractory carbon as in the Solar System and in white dwarfs polluted by extrasolar planetesimals. Our main findings are: (1) Envelope enrichment by planetesimal impacts during formation dominates the final planetary atmospheric composition of hot Jupiters. We investigate two, under this finding, prototypical formation pathways: a formation inside or outside the water iceline, called "dry" and "wet" planets, respectively. (2) Both the "dry" and "wet" planets are oxygen-rich (C/O{\textless}1) due to the oxygen-rich nature of the solid building blocks. The "dry" planet's C/O ratio is {\textless}0.2 for standard carbon depletion, while the "wet" planet has typical C/O values between 0.1 and 0.5 depending mainly on the clathrate formation efficiency. Only non-standard disk chemistries without carbon depletion lead to carbon-rich C/O ratios {\textgreater}1 for the "dry" planet. (3) While we consistently find C/O ratios {\textless}1, they still vary significantly. To link a formation history to a specific C/O, a better understanding of the disk chemistry is thus needed.},

Our major findings suggest that fractional cloud coverage can exactly mimic high mean molecular weight atmospheres and vice-versa over certain wavelength regions, in particular, over the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) bandpass (1.1-1.7 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m). We also find that patchy cloud coverage exhibits a signature that is different from uniform global clouds. Furthermore, we explain analytically why the "patchy cloud-high mean molecular weight" degeneracy exists. We also explore the degeneracy of non-uniform cloud coverage in atmospheric retrievals on both synthetic and real planets. We find from retrievals on a synthetic solar composition hot Jupiter with patchy clouds and a cloud free high mean molecular weight warm Neptune, that both cloud free high mean molecular weight atmospheres and partially cloudy atmospheres can explain the data equally well. Another key find is that the HST WFC3 transit transmission spectra of two well observed objects, the hot Jupiter HD189733b and the warm Neptune HAT-P-11b, can be explained well by solar composition atmospheres with patchy clouds without the need to invoke high mean molecular weight or global clouds. The degeneracy between high molecular weight and solar composition partially cloudy atmospheres can be broken by observing the molecular Rayleigh scattering differences between the two. Furthermore, the signature of partially cloudy limbs also appears as a \${\textbackslash}sim\$100 ppm residual in the ingress and egress of the transit light curves, provided the transit timing is known to seconds.},

We revisit the ‘normalization degeneracy’: the relative abundances of molecules are degenerate at the order-of-magnitude level with the absolute normalization of the transmission spectrum. Using a suite of mock retrievals, we demonstrate that the normalization degeneracy may be partially broken using WFC3 data alone, even in the absence of optical/visible data and without appealing to the presence of patchy clouds, although lower limits to the mixing ratios may be prior-dominated depending on the measurement uncertainties. With James Webb Space Telescope-like spectral resolutions, the normalization degeneracy may be completely broken from infrared spectra alone. We ﬁnd no trend in the retrieved water abundances across nearly two orders of magnitude in exoplanet mass and a factor of 5 in retrieved temperature (about 500–2500 K). We further show that there is a general lack of strong Bayesian evidence to support interpretations of non-grey over grey clouds (only for WASP-69b and WASP-76b) and non-isothermal over isothermal atmospheres (no objects). 35 out of 38 WFC3 transmission spectra are well ﬁtted by an isothermal transit chord with grey clouds and water only, while 8 are adequately explained by ﬂat lines. Generally, the cloud composition is unconstrained.},

HD 189733b is one of the most extensively studied exoplanets and is a corner stone for hot Jupiter models. In this paper, we report the day-side emission spectrum of HD 189733b in the wavelength range 1.1 to 1.7 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 in spatial scan mode. The quality of the data is such that even a straightforward analysis yields a high precision Poisson noise limited spectrum: the median 1-\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ uncertainty is 57 ppm per 0.02 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m bin. We also build a white-light curve correcting for systematic effects and derive an absolute eclipse depth of 96\${\textbackslash}pm\$39 ppm. The resulting spectrum shows marginal evidence for water vapor absorption, but can also be well explained by a blackbody spectrum. However, the combination of these WFC3 data with previous Spitzer photometric observations is best explained by a day-side atmosphere of HD 189733b with no thermal inversion and a nearly solar or sub-solar H\$\_2\$O abundance in a cloud-free atmosphere. Alternatively, this apparent sub-solar abundance may be the result of clouds or hazes which future studies need to investigate.},

We measure mass fractions of \${\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}log H\_2O = -2.0{\textasciicircum}\{+0.4\}\_\{-0.4\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}log CO = -2.2{\textasciicircum}\{+0.5\}\_\{-0.5\}\$, and place upper limits on the remaining species. Notably, we find \${\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}log CH\_4 {\textless} -4.5\$ at 99{\textbackslash}\% confidence, despite its anticipated presence at the equilibrium temperature of HD 189733 b assuming local thermal equilibrium. We make a tentative (\${\textbackslash}sim3{\textbackslash}sigma\$) detection of \${\textbackslash}rm {\textasciicircum}\{13\}CO\$, and the retrieved posteriors suggest a \${\textbackslash}rm {\textasciicircum}\{12\}C/{\textasciicircum}\{13\}C\$ ratio similar to or substantially less than the local interstellar value. The possible \${\textbackslash}rm {\textasciicircum}\{13\}C\$ enrichment would be consistent with accretion of fractionated material in ices or in the protoplanetary disk midplane. The retrieved abundances correspond to a substantially sub-stellar atmospheric \${\textbackslash}rm C/O = 0.3{\textbackslash}pm0.1\$, while the carbon and oxygen abundances are stellar to slightly super-stellar, consistent with core-accretion models which predict an inverse correlation between C/O and metallicity. The specific combination of low C/O and high metallicity suggests significant accretion of solid material may have occurred late in the formation process of HD 189733 b.},

	abstract = {The newfound ability to detect SO2 in exoplanet atmospheres presents an opportunity to measure sulfur abundances and so directly test between competing modes of planet formation. In contrast to carbon and oxygen, whose dominant molecules are frequently observed, sulfur is much less volatile and resides almost exclusively in solid form in protoplanetary disks. This dichotomy leads different models of planet formation to predict different compositions of gas giant planets. Whereas planetesimal-based models predict roughly stellar C/S and O/S ratios, pebble-accretion models more often predict superstellar ratios. To explore the detectability of SO2 in transmission spectra and its ability to diagnose planet formation, we present a grid of atmospheric photochemical models and corresponding synthetic spectra for WASP-39b (where SO2 has been detected). Our 3D grid contains 113 models (spanning 1–100× the solar abundance ratio of C, O, and S) for thermal proﬁles corresponding to the morning and evening terminators, as well as mean terminator transmission spectra. Our models show that for a WASP-39b-like O/H and C/H enhancement of ∼10× solar, SO2 can only be seen for C/S and O/S  1.5× solar, and that WASP39b’s reported SO2 abundance of 1–10 ppm may be more consistent with planetesimal accretion than with pebbleaccretion models (although some pebble models also manage to predict similarly low ratios). More extreme C/S and O/S ratios may be detectable in higher-metallicity atmospheres, suggesting that smaller and more metal-rich gas and ice giants may be particularly interesting targets for testing planet formation models. Future studies should explore the dependence of SO2 on a wider array of planetary and stellar parameters, both for the prototypical SO2 planet WASP-39b, as well as for other hot Jupiters and smaller gas giants.},

	abstract = {Oxygen is the most common element after hydrogen and helium in Jupiter’s atmosphere, and may have been the primary condensable (as water ice) in the protoplanetary disk. Prior to the Juno mission, in situ measurements of Jupiter’s water abundance were obtained from the Galileo probe, which dropped into a meteorologically anomalous site. The findings of the Galileo probe were inconclusive because the concentration of water was still increasing when the probe ceased sending data. Here we report on the water abundance in the equatorial region (0 to 4 degrees north latitude), based on data taken at 1.25 to 22 GHz from the Juno microwave radiometer, probing pressures of approximately 0.7 to 30 bar. Because Juno discovered the deep atmosphere to be surprisingly variable as a function of latitude, it remains to confirm whether the equatorial abundance represents Jupiter’s global water abundance. The water abundance at the equatorial region is inferred to be \$\$2.5\_\{ - 1.6\}{\textasciicircum}\{ + 2.2\} {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}3\$\$ ppm, or \$\$2.7\_\{ - 1.7\}{\textasciicircum}\{ + 2.4\}\$\$ times the elemental ratio of protosolar oxygen to hydrogen (1σ uncertainties). If this reflects the global water abundance, the result suggests that the planetesimals that formed Jupiter were unlikely to have been water-rich clathrate hydrates.},

	abstract = {Debris disks are tenuous, dust-dominated disks commonly observed around stars over a wide range of ages. Those around main sequence stars are analogous to the Solar System's Kuiper Belt and zodiacal light. The dust in debris disks is believed to be continuously regenerated, originating primarily with collisions of planetesimals. Observations of debris disks provide insight into the evolution of planetary systems; and the composition of dust, comets, and planetesimals outside the Solar System; as well as placing constraints on the orbital architecture and potentially the masses of exoplanets that are not otherwise detectable. This review highlights recent advances in multiwavelength, high-resolution scattered light and thermal imaging that have revealed a complex and intricate diversity of structures in debris disks and discusses how modeling methods are evolving with the breadth and depth of the available observations. Two rapidly advancing subfields highlighted in this review include observations of atomic and molecular gas around main sequence stars and variations in emission from debris disks on very short (days to years) timescales, providing evidence of non-steady-state collisional evolution particularly in young debris disks.},

Transmission spectra for these atmospheres were created using the modelling framework ARCiS. We varied model parameters such as the diffusion coefﬁcient Kzz, and we studied the importance of photochemistry on the resulting mixing ratios. Furthermore, we varied the chemical composition of the atmosphere by increasing the metallicity from solar to ten times solar. We also explored different C/O ratios.
Results. We ﬁnd that H2S and SO2 are the best candidates for detection between 1 and 10 µm, using a spectral resolution that is representative of the instruments on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). H2S is easiest to detect at an equilibrium temperature of ∼1500 K, and with C/O ratios between 0.7 and 0.9, with the ideal value increasing slightly for increasing metallicity. SO2 is most likely to be detected at an equilibrium temperature of ∼1000 K at low C/O ratios and high metallicities. Nevertheless, among these two molecules, we expect SO2 detection to be more common, as it is detectable in scenarios more favoured by formation models.
Conclusions. We conclude that H2S and SO2 will most likely be detected in the coming years with the JWST, and that the detection of these species will provide information on atmospheric processes and planet formation scenarios.},

With an approximate radius of 2 R ⊕ and equilibrium temperature of 350 K, TOI-270 d is one of the most promising small exoplanets for atmospheric characterization using transit spectroscopy. Here we present a primary transit observation of TOI-270 d made with the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) spectrograph across the 1.126–1.644 μm wavelength range, and a 95\% credible upper limit of 8.2 × 10−14 erg s−1 cm−2 Å−1 arcsec−2 for the stellar Lyα emission obtained using the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph. The transmission spectrum derived from the TESS and WFC3 data provides evidence for molecular absorption by a hydrogen-rich atmosphere at 4σ significance relative to a featureless spectrum. The strongest evidence for any individual absorber is obtained for H2O, which is favored at 3σ significance. When retrieving on the WFC3 data alone and allowing for the possibility of a heterogeneous stellar brightness profile, the detection significance of H2O is reduced to 2.8σ. Further observations are therefore required to robustly determine the atmospheric composition of TOI-270 d and assess the impact of stellar heterogeneity. If confirmed, our findings would make TOI-270 d one of the smallest and coolest exoplanets to date with detected atmospheric spectral features.},

The narrowness of the feature could be due to an obscuring high-altitude haze of an unknown composition or a signiﬁcantly sub-solar Na I abundance hiding the line wings beneath an H2 Rayleigh signature. These observations are consistent with previous broad-band spectroscopy from Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) and STIS, where a featureless spectrum was seen. We also investigate the effects of starspots on the Na I line proﬁle, ﬁnding that their impact is minimal and within errors in the sodium feature.},

	abstract = {Over the last decade, precise exoplanet transmission spectroscopy has revealed the atmospheres of dozens of exoplanets, driven largely by observatories like the {\textbackslash}textit\{Hubble\} Space Telescope. One major discovery has been the ubiquity of atmospheric aerosols, often blocking access to exoplanet chemical inventories. Tentative trends have been identified, showing that the clarity of planetary atmospheres may depend on equilibrium temperature. Previous work has often grouped dissimilar planets together in order to increase the statistical power of any trends, but it remains unclear from observed transmission spectra whether these planets exhibit the same atmospheric physics and chemistry. We present a re-analysis of a smaller, more physically similar sample of 15 exo-Neptune transmission spectra across a wide range of temperatures (200-1000 K). Using condensation cloud and hydrocarbon haze models, we find that the exo-Neptune population is best described by very low cloud sedimentation efficiency (\${\textbackslash}mathrm\{f\_\{sed\}\}{\textbackslash}sim0.01\$) and high metallicity (\$100{\textbackslash}times\$ Solar). There is an intrinsic astrophysical scatter of \${\textbackslash}sim0.5\$ scale height, perhaps evidence of stochasticity in these planets' formation processes. Observers should expect significant attenuation in transmission spectra of Neptune-size exoplanets, up to 6 scale heights for equilibrium temperatures between 500 and 800{\textasciitilde}K. With JWST's greater wavelength sensitivity, colder (\${\textless}500\${\textasciitilde}K) planets should be high-priority targets given their comparative rarity, clearer atmospheres, and the need to distinguish between the ``super-puffs'' and more typical gas-dominated planets.},

	abstract = {After 25 years of the prediction of the possibility of observations, and despite the many hundred of well studied transiting exoplanet systems, we are still waiting for the announcement of the first confirmed exomoon. Following the ``cascade'' structure of the Drake-equation, but applied to the existence of an observable exomoon instead the original scope of extraterrestrial intelligence. The scope of this paper is to reveal the structure of the problem, rather than giving a quantitative solution. We identify three important steps that can lead us to the discovery. The steps are the formation, the orbital dynamics and long-term stability, and the observability of a given exomoon in a given system. This way, the question will be closely related to questions of star formation, planet formation, 5 possible pathways of moon formation; long-term dynamics of evolved planet systems involving stellar and planetary rotation and internal structure; and the proper evaluation of the observed data, taken the correlated noise of stellar and instrumental origin and the sampling function also into account. This way, a successful exomoon observation and the interpretations of the expectable further measurements proves to be among the most complex and most interdisciplinary questions in astrophysics.},

We simulate applying the technique to a potentially habitable Proxima b-like planet and show that the O2 A-band spectral feature could feasibly be detected on nearby rocky exoplanets using future instruments on the ELT. The technique is then more widely analysed showing that detections of planets and O2 with signal-to-noise ratio in the CC function (SNRCC) {\textgreater}3 can be obtained when the signal-to-noise ratio of the simulated planet spectrum (SNRspec) is from 0.25 to 1.2. We place constraints on the spectral resolution, instrument contrast, point spread function (PSF), exposure times and systematic error in stellar light subtraction for making such detections. We ﬁnd that accurate stellar light subtraction (with 99.99 per cent removal) and PSFs with high spatial resolutions are key to making detections. Lastly a further investigation suggests the ELT could potentially discover and characterize planets of all sizes around different spectral type stars, as well as detecting O2 on super-Earths with habitable zone orbits around nearby M stars.},

Measurements allow us to retrieve the vertically averaged concentration of gases between 3 and 5 bars from infrared-bright spectra. Results were used to create latitudinal profiles. The water vapor relative humidity varies with latitude from {\textless}1\% to over 15\%. At intermediate latitudes (30–70°) the water vapor maxima are associated with the location of cyclonic belts, as inferred from mean zonal wind profiles (Porco et al., 2003). The high-latitude regions (beyond 60°) are drier in the north (mean relative humidity around 2–3\%) than the south, where humidity reaches 15\% around the pole. The ammonia volume mixing ratio varies from 1 × 10−4 to 4 × 10−4. A marked minimum exists around 10°N, while data suggest an increase over the equator. The high-latitude regions are different in the two hemispheres, with a gradual increase in the south and more constant values with latitude in the north. The phosphine volume mixing ratio varies from 4 × 10−7 to 10 × 10−7. A marked minimum exists in the North Equatorial Belt. For latitudes poleward 30°S and 30°N, the northern hemisphere appears richer in phosphine, with a decrease toward the pole, while the opposite is observed in the south. JIRAM data indicate an increase of germane volume mixing ratio from 2 × 10−10 to 8 × 10−10 from both poles to 15°S, with a depletion centered around the equator. Arsine presents the opposite trend, with maximum values of 6 × 10−10 at the two poles and minima below 1 × 10−10 around 20°S.},

This wavelength range can warm and ionize terrestrial planets’ upper atmospheres, which expands the planetary radius and promotes atmospheric loss. In this work, we study the contribution of the XUV flux due to flares on the atmospheric escape of Earth-like planets orbiting M dwarfs through numerical simulations. We considered the first Gyr of planets with initial surface water abundances between 1 and 10 terrestrial oceans (TO), a small primordial hydrogen envelope (≤10−3 M ⊕), and with host-star masses between 0.2 and 0.6 M ⊙. In this parameter range, we find that flares can remove up to two TO more than nonflaring stars, which, in some cases, translates to a doubling of the total water loss. We also find that flaring can increase atmospheric oxygen partial pressures by hundreds of bars in some cases. These results were obtained by adding a new module for flares to the VPLanet software package and upgrading its atmospheric escape module to account for Roche lobe overflow and radiation/recombination-limited escape.},

To this effect, we carry out numerical simulations to characterize the stellar wind of TRAPPIST-1 and the atmospheric ion escape rates for all of the seven planets. We also estimate the escape rates analytically and demonstrate that they are in good agreement with the numerical results. We conclude that the outer planets of the TRAPPIST-1 system are capable of retaining their atmospheres over billion-year timescales. The consequences arising from our results are also explored in the context of abiogenesis, biodiversity, and searches for future exoplanets.

Now, the growing number of exoplanet observations enable estimation of these elements in exoplanetary atmospheres. In hot Jupiters, the C/O ratio affects the partitioning of carbon in the major observable molecules, making these elements diagnostic of temperature structure and composition. Here we present measurements of carbon and oxygen abundances in 16 stars that host transiting hot Jupiter exoplanets, and we compare our C/O ratios to those measured in larger samples of host stars, as well as those estimated for the corresponding exoplanet atmospheres. With standard stellar abundance analysis we derive stellar parameters as well as [C/H] and [O/H] from multiple abundance indicators, including synthesis ﬁtting of the [O i] λ6300 line and non-LTE corrections for the O i triplet. Our results, in agreement with recent suggestions, indicate that previously measured exoplanet host star C/O ratios may have been overestimated. The mean transiting exoplanet host star C/O ratio from this sample is 0.54 (C/O = 0.54), versus previously measured C/Ohost star means of ∼0.65–0.75. We also observe the increase in C/O with [Fe/H] expected for all stars based on Galactic chemical evolution; a linear ﬁt to our results falls slightly below that of other exoplanet host star studies but has a similar slope. Though the C/O ratios of even the most-observed exoplanets are still uncertain, the more precise abundance analysis possible right now for their host stars can help constrain these planets’ formation environments and current compositions.},

This class of giant planets receives intense radiation from their host star and usually has strongly irradiated and highly inﬂated atmospheres. At such a high temperature, cloud formation is expected to be suppressed and thermal dissociation of water vapor could occur. We observed the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-76b with seven transits and ﬁve eclipses using the Hubble Space Telescope and the Spitzer Space Telescope (Spitzer) for a comprehensive study of its atmospheric chemical and physical processes. We detected TiO and H2O absorption in the optical and near-infrared transit spectrum. Additional absorption by a number of neutral and ionized heavy metals like Fe, Ni, Ti, and SiO help explain the short-wavelength transit spectrum. The secondary eclipse spectrum shows muted water feature but a strong CO emission feature in Spitzer’s 4.5 μm band indicating an inverted temperature pressure proﬁle. We analyzed both the transit and eclipse spectra with a combination of self-consistent PHOENIX models and atmospheric retrieval. Both spectra were well ﬁtted by the self-consistent PHOENIX forward atmosphere model in chemical and radiative equilibrium at solar metallicity, adding to the growing evidence that both TiO/VO and NUV heavy metals opacity are prominent NUV-optical opacity sources in the stratospheres of ultra-hot Jupiters.},

	abstract = {Eclipse mapping is a technique for inferring 2D brightness maps of transiting exoplanets from the shape of an eclipse light curve. With JWST's unmatched precision, eclipse mapping is now possible for a large number of exoplanets. However, eclipse mapping has only been applied to two planets and the nuances of fitting eclipse maps are not yet fully understood. Here, we use Leave-one-out Cross- Validation (LOO-CV) to investigate eclipse mapping, with application to a JWST NIRISS/SOSS observation of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-18b. LOO-CV is a technique that provides insight into the out-of-sample predictive power of models on a data-point-by-data-point basis. We show that constraints on planetary brightness patterns behave as expected, with large-scale variations driven by the phase-curve variation in the light curve and smaller-scale structures constrained by the eclipse ingress and egress. For WASP-18b we show that the need for higher model complexity (smaller-scale features) is driven exclusively by the shape of the eclipse ingress and egress. We use LOO-CV to investigate the relationship between planetary brightness map components when mapping under a positive-flux constraint to better understand the need for complex models. Finally, we use LOO-CV to understand the degeneracy between the competing ``hotspot'' and ``plateau'' brightness map models of WASP-18b, showing that the plateau model is driven by the ingress shape and the hotspot model is driven by the egress shape, but preference for neither model is due to outliers or unmodeled signals. Based on this analysis, we make recommendations for the use of LOO-CV in future eclipse-mapping studies.},

However, no unambiguous photochemical products have been detected in exoplanet atmospheres so far. Recent observations from the JWST Transiting Exoplanet Community Early Release Science Program2,3 found a spectral absorption feature at 4.05 μm arising from sulfur dioxide (SO2) in the atmosphere of WASP-39b. WASP-39b is a 1.27-Jupiter-radii, Saturn-mass (0.28 MJ) gas giant exoplanet orbiting a Sun-like star with an equilibrium temperature of around 1,100 K (ref. 4). The most plausible way of generating SO2 in such an atmosphere is through photochemical processes5,6. Here we show that the SO2 distribution computed by a suite of photochemical models robustly explains the 4.05-μm spectral feature identified by JWST transmission observations7 with NIRSpec PRISM (2.7σ)8 and G395H (4.5σ)9. SO2 is produced by successive oxidation of sulfur radicals freed when hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is destroyed. The sensitivity of the SO2 feature to the enrichment of the atmosphere by heavy elements (metallicity) suggests that it can be used as a tracer of atmospheric properties, with WASP-39b exhibiting an inferred metallicity of about 10× solar. We further point out that SO2 also shows observable features at ultraviolet and thermal infrared wavelengths not available from the existing observations.},

Previous HST WFC3 observations of GJ 1132 b were inconclusive, with evidence reported for either an atmosphere or a featureless spectrum based on analyses of the same dataset. Our JWST data exhibit substantial differences between the two visits. One transit is consistent with either a H\$\_2\$O-dominated atmosphere containing {\textasciitilde}1\% CH\$\_4\$ and trace N\$\_2\$O (\${\textbackslash}chi{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\_\{{\textbackslash}nu\}\$ = 1.13) or stellar contamination from unocculted starspots (\${\textbackslash}chi{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\_\{{\textbackslash}nu\}\$ = 1.36). However, the second transit is consistent with a featureless spectrum. Neither visit is consistent with a previous report of HCN. Atmospheric variability is unlikely to explain the scale of the observed differences between the visits. Similarly, our out-of-transit stellar spectra show no evidence of changing stellar inhomogeneity between the two visits - observed 8 days apart, only 6.5\% of the stellar rotation rate. We further find no evidence of differing instrumental systematic effects between visits. The most plausible explanation is an unlucky random noise draw leading to two significantly discrepant transmission spectra. Our results highlight the importance of multi-visit repeatability with JWST prior to claiming atmospheric detections for these small, enigmatic planets.},

	abstract = {TRAPPIST-1 is a nearby system of seven Earth-sized, temperate, rocky exoplanets transiting a Jupiter-sized M8.5V star, ideally suited for in-depth atmospheric studies. Each TRAPPIST-1 planet has been observed in transmission both from space and from the ground, conﬁdently rejecting cloud-free, hydrogen-rich atmospheres. Secondary eclipse observations of TRAPPIST-1 b with JWST/MIRI are consistent with little to no atmosphere given the lack of heat redistribution. Here we present the ﬁrst transmission spectra of TRAPPIST-1 b obtained with JWST/NIRISS over two visits. The two transmission spectra show moderate to strong evidence of contamination from unocculted stellar heterogeneities, which dominates the signal in both visits. The transmission spectrum of the ﬁrst visit is consistent with unocculted starspots and the second visit exhibits signatures of unocculted faculae. Fitting the stellar contamination and planetary atmosphere either sequentially or simultaneously, we conﬁrm the absence of cloud-free, hydrogen-rich atmospheres, but cannot assess the presence of secondary atmospheres. We ﬁnd that the uncertainties associated with the lack of stellar model ﬁdelity are one order of magnitude above the observation precision of 89 ppm (combining the two visits). Without affecting the conclusion regarding the atmosphere of TRAPPIST-1 b, this highlights an important caveat for future explorations, which calls for additional observations to characterize stellar heterogeneities empirically and/or theoretical works to improve model ﬁdelity for such cool stars. This need is all the more justiﬁed as stellar contamination can affect the search for atmospheres around the outer, cooler TRAPPIST-1 planets for which transmission spectroscopy is currently the most efﬁcient technique.},

	abstract = {Evidence of disequilibrium chemistry due to vertical mixing in the atmospheres of many T- and Y-dwarfs has been inferred due to enhanced mixing ratios of CO and reduced NH3. Atmospheric models of planets and brown dwarfs typically parameterize this vertical mixing phenomenon with the vertical eddy diffusion coefﬁcient, Kzz. While Kzz can perhaps be approximated in the convective regions in the atmosphere with mixing length theory, in radiative regions, the strength of vertical mixing is uncertain by many orders of magnitude. With a new grid of selfconsistent 1D model atmospheres from Teff of 400–1000 K, computed with a new radiative-convective equilibrium python code PICASO 3.0, we aim to assess how molecular abundances and corresponding spectra can be used as a probe of depth-dependent Kzz. At a given surface gravity, we ﬁnd nonmonotonic behavior in the CO abundance as a function of Teff, as chemical abundances are sometimes quenched in either of two potential atmospheric convective zones, or quenched in either of two possible radiative zones. The temperature structure and chemical quenching behavior also change with gravity. We compare our models with available near-infrared and M-band spectroscopy of several T- and Y-dwarfs and assess their atmospheric vertical mixing proﬁles. We also compare to color–magnitude diagrams and make predictions for James Webb Space Telescope spectra. This work yields new constraints, and points the way to signiﬁcant future gains, in determining Kzz, a fundamental atmospheric parameter in substellar atmospheres, with signiﬁcant implications for chemistry and cloud modeling.},

However, thanks to the high number of extrasolar planets that have been discovered, it is now possible to look at the planets as a population that puts statistical constraints on theoretical formation models. A method that uses these constraints is planetary population synthesis where synthetic planetary populations are generated and compared to the actual population. The key element of the population synthesis method is a global model of planet formation and evolution. These models directly predict observable planetary properties based on properties of the natal protoplanetary disc, linking two important classes of astrophysical objects. To do so, global models build on the simplified results of many specialized models that address one specific physical mechanism. We thoroughly review the physics of the sub-models included in global formation models. The sub-models can be classified as models describing the protoplanetary disc (of gas and solids), those that describe one (proto)planet (its solid core, gaseous envelope and atmosphere), and finally those that describe the interactions (orbital migration and N-body interaction). We compare the approaches taken in different global models, discuss the links between specialized and global models, and identify physical processes that require improved descriptions in future work. We then shortly address important results of planetary population synthesis like the planetary mass function or the mass–radius relationship. With these statistical results, the global effects of physical mechanisms occurring during planet formation and evolution become apparent, and specialized models describing them can be put to the observational test. Owing to their nature as meta models, global models depend on the results of specialized models, and therefore on the development of the field of planet formation theory as a whole. Because there are important uncertainties in this theory, it is likely that the global models will in future undergo significant modifications. Despite these limitations, global models can already now yield many testable predictions. With future global models addressing the geophysical characteristics of the synthetic planets, it should eventually become possible to make predictions about the habitability of planets based on their formation and evolution.},

              The carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio in an exoplanet atmosphere has been suggested as a potential diagnostic of planet formation. Now that a number of exoplanets have measured C/O ratios, it is possible to examine this diagnostic at a population level. Here, we present an analysis of currently measured C/O ratios of directly imaged and transit/eclipse planets. First, we derive atmospheric parameters for the substellar companion HD 284149 AB b using data taken with the OSIRIS integral field spectrograph at the W.M.

This has been a challenge for the impact theory, because the impactor’s composition would have likely differed from that of Earth. We simulated impacts involving larger impactors than previously considered. We show that these can produce a disk with the same composition as the planet’s mantle, consistent with Earth-Moon compositional similarities. Such impacts require subsequent removal of angular momentum from the Earth-Moon system through a resonance with the Sun as recently proposed.},

	abstract = {Methods. The molecular composition of the gas above a surface made of a mixture of solid and liquid materials was determined by assuming phase equilibrium for given pressure, temperature, and element abundances. We study total element abundances that represent different parts of the Earth’s crust (continental crust, bulk silicate Earth, mid oceanic ridge basalt), CI chondrites and abundances measured in polluted white dwarfs.
Results. For temperatures between ∼600 and ∼3500 K, the near-crust atmospheres of all considered total element abundances are mainly composed of H2O, CO2, and SO2 and in some cases of O2 and H2. For temperatures 500 K, only N2-rich or CH4-rich atmospheres remain. For 3500 K, the atmospheric gas is mainly composed of atoms (O, Na, Mg, and Fe), metal oxides (SiO, NaO, MgO, CaO, AlO, and FeO), and some metal hydroxides (KOH and NaOH). The inclusion of phyllosilicates as potential condensed species is crucial for lower temperatures, as they can remove water from the gas phase below about 700 K and inhibit the presence of liquid water.
Conclusions. Measurements of the atmospheric composition could, in principle, characterise the rock composition of exoplanet crusts. H2O, O2 and CH4 are natural products from the outgassing of different kinds of rocks that had time to equilibrate. These are discussed as biomarkers, but they do emerge naturally as a result of the thermodynamic interaction between the crust and atmosphere. Only the simultaneous detection of all three molecules might be a sufﬁcient biosignature, as it is inconsistent with chemical equilibrium.},

We perform laboratory outgassing experiments that use a mass spectrometer to measure the abundances of volatiles released when meteorite samples are heated to 1,200 °C. We find that outgassing from three carbonaceous chondrite samples consistently produce H2O-rich (average of {\textasciitilde}66\%) atmospheres but with substantial amounts of CO ({\textasciitilde}18\%) and CO2 ({\textasciitilde}15\%) as well as smaller quantities of H2 and H2S (up to 1\%).

Addressing this question requires improved modeling of water-rich exoplanetary atmospheres, both to predict and interpret spectroscopic observations and to serve as upper boundary conditions on interior structure calculations. Here, we present new models of hydrogenhelium-water atmospheres with water abundances ranging from solar to 100\% water vapor. We improve upon previous models of high-water-content atmospheres by incorporating updated prescriptions for water selfbroadening and a nonideal gas equation of state. Our model grid (https://umd.box.com/v/water-worlds) includes temperature–pressure proﬁles in radiative-convective equilibrium, along with their associated transmission and thermal emission spectra. We ﬁnd that our model updates primarily act at high pressures, signiﬁcantly impacting bottom-of-atmosphere temperatures, with implications for the accuracy of interior structure calculations. Upperatmosphere conditions and spectroscopic observables are less impacted by our model updates, and we ﬁnd that, under most conditions, retrieval codes built for hot Jupiters should also perform well on water-rich planets. We additionally quantify the observational degeneracies among both thermal emission and transmission spectra. We recover standard degeneracies with clouds and mean molecular weight for transmission spectra, and we ﬁnd thermal emission spectra to be more readily distinguishable from one another in the water-poor (i.e., near-solar) regime.},

We ﬁnd that the atmospheric radiative transfer is signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the cool M-star irradiation; H2O and CO2 absorption bands in the near-infrared are strong enough to absorb a sizeable fraction of the incoming stellar light at low pressures, which leads to temperature inversions in the upper atmosphere. The non-gray band structure of gaseous opacities in the infrared is hereby an important factor. Opacity windows are muted at higher atmospheric temperatures, so we expect temperature inversions to be common only for sufﬁciently cool planets. We also ﬁnd that pure CO2 atmospheres exhibit lower overall temperatures and stronger reﬂection spectra compared to models of the other compositions. We estimate that for GJ 1132b and LHS 3844b we should be able to distinguish between different atmospheric compositions with JWST. The emission lines from the predicted temperature inversions are currently hard to measure, but high-resolution spectroscopy with future extremely large telescopes may be able to detect them.},

	abstract = {About 1 out of 200 Sun-like stars has a planet with an orbital period shorter than one day: an ultrashort-period planet1,2. All of the previously known ultrashort-period planets are either hot Jupiters, with sizes above 10 Earth radii (R⊕), or apparently rocky planets smaller than 2 R⊕. Such lack of planets of intermediate size (the ‘hot Neptune desert’) has been interpreted as the inability of low-mass planets to retain any hydrogen/helium (H/He) envelope in the face of strong stellar irradiation. Here we report the discovery of an ultrashort-period planet with a radius of 4.6 R⊕ and a mass of 29 M⊕, firmly in the hot Neptune desert. Data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite3 revealed transits of the bright Sun-like star LTT 9779 every 0.79 days. The planet’s mean density is similar to that of Neptune, and according to thermal evolution models, it has a H/He-rich envelope constituting 9.0\$\$\{\}\_\{-2.9\}{\textasciicircum}\{+2.7\}\$\$\% of the total mass. With an equilibrium temperature around 2,000 K, it is unclear how this ‘ultrahot Neptune’ managed to retain such an envelope. Follow-up observations of the planet’s atmosphere to better understand its origin and physical nature will be facilitated by the star’s brightness (Vmag = 9.8).},

	abstract = {The interiors of giant planets remain poorly understood. Even for the planets in the Solar System, difficulties in observation lead to large uncertainties in the properties of planetary cores. Exoplanets that have undergone rare evolutionary processes provide a route to understanding planetary interiors. Planets found in and near the typically barren hot-Neptune ‘desert’1,2 (a region in mass–radius space that contains few planets) have proved to be particularly valuable in this regard. These planets include HD149026b3, which is thought to have an unusually massive core, and recent discoveries such as LTT9779b4 and NGTS-4b5, on which photoevaporation has removed a substantial part of their outer atmospheres. Here we report observations of the planet TOI-849b, which has a radius smaller than Neptune’s but an anomalously large mass of \$\$39.1\{{\textbackslash},\}\_\{-2.6\}{\textasciicircum}\{+2.7\}\$\$ Earth masses and a density of \$\$5.2\{{\textbackslash},\}\_\{-0.8\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.7\}\$\$ grams per cubic centimetre, similar to Earth’s. Interior-structure models suggest that any gaseous envelope of pure hydrogen and helium consists of no more than \$\$\{3.9\}\_\{-0.9\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.8\}\$\$ per cent of the total planetary mass. The planet could have been a gas giant before undergoing extreme mass loss via thermal self-disruption or giant planet collisions, or it could have avoided substantial gas accretion, perhaps through gap opening or late formation6. Although photoevaporation rates cannot account for the mass loss required to reduce a Jupiter-like gas giant, they can remove a small (a few Earth masses) hydrogen and helium envelope on timescales of several billion years, implying that any remaining atmosphere on TOI-849b is likely to be enriched by water or other volatiles from the planetary interior. We conclude that TOI-849b is the remnant core of a giant planet.},

	abstract = {Although current sensitivity limits are such that true solar system analogs remain challenging to detect, numerous planetary systems have been discovered that are very different from our own solar system. The majority of systems harbor a new class of planets, bodies that are typically several times more massive than the Earth but orbit their host stars well inside the orbit of Mercury. These planets frequently show evidence for large hydrogen and helium envelopes containing several percent of the planet’s mass and display a large diversity in mean densities. Here we show that this wide range can be achieved by one or two late giant impacts, which are frequently needed to achieve long-term orbital stability in multiple planet systems once the gas disk has disappeared. We demonstrate using hydrodynamical simulations that a single collision between similarly sized exoplanets can easily reduce the envelope-to-core-mass ratio by a factor of two and show that this leads to a corresponding increase in the observed mean density by factors of two to three. In addition, we investigate how envelope mass loss depends on envelope mass, planet radius, semimajor axis, and the mass distribution inside the envelope. We propose that a small number of giant impacts may be responsible for the large observed spread in mean densities, especially for multiple-planet systems that contain planets with very different densities and have not been significantly sculpted by photoevaporation.},

	abstract = {Models of terrestrial planet formation predict that the final stages of planetary assembly—lasting tens of millions of years beyond the dispersal of young protoplanetary disks—are dominated by planetary collisions. It is through these giant impacts that planets like the young Earth grow to their final mass and achieve long-term stable orbital configurations1. A key prediction is that these impacts produce debris. So far, the most compelling observational evidence for post-impact debris comes from the planetary system around the nearby 23-million-year-old A-type star HD 172555. This system shows large amounts of fine dust with an unusually steep size distribution and atypical dust composition, previously attributed to either a hypervelocity impact2,3 or a massive asteroid belt4. Here we report the spectrally resolved detection of a carbon monoxide gas ring co-orbiting with dusty debris around HD 172555 between about six and nine astronomical units—a region analogous to the outer terrestrial planet region of our Solar System. Taken together, the dust and carbon monoxide detections favour a giant impact between large, volatile-rich bodies. This suggests that planetary-scale collisions, analogous to the Moon-forming impact, can release large amounts of gas as well as debris, and that this gas is observable, providing a window into the composition of young planets.},

	abstract = {Measures of exoplanet bulk densities indicate that small exoplanets with radius less than 3 Earth radii (R⊕) range from low-density sub-Neptunes containing volatile elements1 to higher-density rocky planets with Earth-like2 or iron-rich3 (Mercury-like) compositions. Such astonishing diversity in observed small exoplanet compositions may be the product of different initial conditions of the planet-formation process or different evolutionary paths that altered the planetary properties after formation4. Planet evolution may be especially affected by either photoevaporative mass loss induced by high stellar X-ray and extreme ultraviolet (XUV) flux5 or giant impacts6. Although there is some evidence for the former7,8, there are no unambiguous findings so far about the occurrence of giant impacts in an exoplanet system. Here, we characterize the two innermost planets of the compact and near-resonant system Kepler-107 (ref. 9). We show that they have nearly identical radii (about 1.5–1.6R⊕), but the outer planet Kepler-107 c is more than twice as dense (about 12.6 g cm–3) as the innermost Kepler-107 b (about 5.3 g cm−3). In consequence, Kepler-107 c must have a larger iron core fraction than Kepler-107 b. This imbalance cannot be explained by the stellar XUV irradiation, which would conversely make the more-irradiated and less-massive planet Kepler-107 b denser than Kepler-107 c. Instead, the dissimilar densities are consistent with a giant impact event on Kepler-107 c that would have stripped off part of its silicate mantle. This hypothesis is supported by theoretical predictions from collisional mantle stripping10, which match the mass and radius of Kepler-107 c.},

Computer models and theory have elucidated the diverse outcomes of giant impacts in detail, improving our ability to interpret collision conditions from observations of their remnants. However, many open questions remain, as even the formation of the Moon—a widely suspected giant-impact product for which we have the most information—is still debated. We review giant-impact theory, the diverse nature of giant-impact outcomes, and the governing physical processes. We discuss the importance of computer simulations, informed by experiments, for accurately modeling the impact process. Finally, we outline how the application of probability theory and computational advancements can assist in inferring collision histories from observations, and we identify promising opportunities for advancing giant-impact theory in the future. ▪Giant impacts exhibit diverse possible outcomes leading to changes in planetary mass, composition, and thermal history depending on the conditions. ▪Improvements to computer simulation methodologies and new laboratory experiments provide critical insights into the detailed outcomes of giant impacts. ▪When colliding planets are similar in size, they can merge or escape one another with roughly equal probability, but with different effects on their resulting masses, densities, and orbits. ▪Different sequences of giant impacts can produce similar planets, encouraging the use of probability theory to evaluate distinct formation hypothesis.},

	abstract = {We present a substantial extension of the millimeter (mm) wave continuum photometry catalog for circumstellar dust disks in the Taurus star-forming region, based on a new “snapshot” λ = 1.3 mm survey with the Submillimeter Array. Combining these new data with measurements in the literature, we construct a mm-wave luminosity distribution, f(Lmm), for Class II disks that is statistically complete for stellar hosts with spectral types earlier than M8.5 and has a 3σ depth of roughly 3 mJy. The resulting census eliminates a longstanding selection bias against disks with late-type hosts, and thereby demonstrates that there is a strong correlation between Lmm and the host spectral type. By translating the locations of individual stars in the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram into masses and ages, and adopting a simple conversion between Lmm and the disk mass, Md, we confirm that this correlation corresponds to a statistically robust relationship between the masses of dust disks and the stars that host them. A Bayesian regression technique is used to characterize these relationships in the presence of measurement errors, data censoring, and significant intrinsic scatter: the best-fit results indicate a typical 1.3 mm flux density of ∼25 mJy for 1 M☉ hosts and a power-law scaling . We suggest that a reasonable treatment of dust temperature in the conversion from Lmm to Md favors an inherently linear Md∝M* scaling, with a typical disk-to-star mass ratio of ∼0.2\%–0.6\%. The measured rms dispersion around this regression curve is ±0.7 dex, suggesting that the combined effects of diverse evolutionary states, dust opacities, and temperatures in these disks imprint a full width at half-maximum range of a factor of ∼40 on the inferred Md (or Lmm) at any given host mass. We argue that this relationship between Md and M* likely represents the origin of the inferred correlation between giant planet frequency and host star mass in the exoplanet population, and provides some basic support for the core accretion model for planet formation. Moreover, we caution that the effects of incompleteness and selection bias must be considered in comparative studies of disk evolution, and illustrate that fact with statistical comparisons of f(Lmm) between the Taurus catalog presented here and incomplete subsamples in the Ophiuchus, IC 348, and Upper Sco young clusters.},

However, studies of Saturn’s rings have detected waves driven by pulsation modes within the planet8–11, offering independent seismic probes of Saturn’s interior12–14. The observations reveal gravity-mode pulsations, which indicate that part of Saturn’s deep interior is stable against convection13. Here, we compare structural models with gravity and seismic measurements from Cassini to show that the data can only be explained by a diffuse, stably stratified core–envelope transition region in Saturn extending to approximately 60\% of the planet’s radius and containing approximately 17 Earth masses of ice and rock. This gradual distribution of heavy elements constrains mixing processes at work in Saturn, and it may reflect the planet’s primordial structure and accretion history.},

The small size of M dwarfs renders their planets exceptional targets for transmission spectroscopy, facilitating atmospheric characterization. However, it remains unknown whether their host stars’ highly variable extreme-UV radiation environments allow atmospheres to persist. With JWST, we have begun to determine whether or not the most favorable rocky worlds orbiting M dwarfs have detectable atmospheres. Here, we present a 2.8–5.2 μm JWST NIRSpec/G395H transmission spectrum of the warm (700 K, 40.3× Earth’s insolation) super-Earth GJ 486b (1.3 R ⊕ and 3.0 M ⊕). The measured spectrum from our two transits of GJ 486b deviates from a flat line at 2.2σ − 3.3σ, based on three independent reductions. Through a combination of forward and retrieval models, we determine that GJ 486b either has a water-rich atmosphere (with the most stringent constraint on the retrieved water abundance of H2O {\textgreater} 10\% to 2σ) or the transmission spectrum is contaminated by water present in cool unocculted starspots. We also find that the measured stellar spectrum is best fit by a stellar model with cool starspots and hot faculae. While both retrieval scenarios provide equal quality fits () to our NIRSpec/G395H observations, shorter wavelength observations can break this degeneracy and reveal if GJ 486b sustains a water-rich atmosphere.},

However, methane has not yet been definitively detected with space-based spectroscopy in the atmosphere of a transiting exoplanet, but a few detections have been made with ground-based, high-resolution transit spectroscopy including a tentative detection for WASP-80b. Here we report transmission and emission spectra spanning 2.4-4.0 micrometers of the 825 K warm Jupiter WASP-80b taken with JWST's NIRCam instrument, both of which show strong evidence for methane at greater than 6-sigma significance. The derived methane abundances from both viewing geometries are consistent with each other and with solar to sub-solar C/O and {\textasciitilde}5\${\textbackslash}times\$ solar metallicity, which is consistent with theoretical predictions.},

Previous studies of HD{\textbackslash},209458b's atmosphere have given conflicting results on the abundance of H\$\_2\$O and the presence of carbon- and nitrogen-bearing species, which have significant ramifications on the inferences of the planet's metallicity (M/H) and carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio. We detect strong features of H\$\_2\$O and CO\$\_2\$ in the JWST transmission spectrum, which when interpreted using a retrieval that assumes thermochemical equilibrium and fractional grey cloud opacity yields \$4{\textasciicircum}\{+5\}\_\{-2\}\$ \${\textbackslash}times\$ solar metallicity and C/O = \$0.08{\textasciicircum}\{+0.09\}\_\{-0.05\}\$. The derived metallicity is consistent with the atmospheric metallicity-planet mass trend observed in solar gas giants. The low C/O ratio suggests that this planet has undergone significant contamination by evaporating planetesimals while migrating inward. We are also able to place upper limits on the abundances of CH\$\_4\$, C\$\_2\$H\$\_2\$ and HCN of log(\${\textbackslash}chi\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{CH\}\_4\}\$) = -4.4, log(\${\textbackslash}chi\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{C\}\_2{\textbackslash}mathrm\{H\}\_2\}\$) = -5.3, and log(\${\textbackslash}chi\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{HCN\}\}\$) = -5.5, which are in tension with the recent claim of a detection of these species using ground-based cross-correlation spectroscopy. We find that HD{\textbackslash},209458b has a weaker CO\$\_2\$ feature size than WASP-39b when comparing their scale-height-normalized transmission spectra. On the other hand, the size of HD{\textbackslash},209458b's H\$\_2\$O feature is stronger, thus reinforcing the low C/O inference.},

	abstract = {Clouds are prevalent in many of the exoplanet atmospheres that have been observed to date. For transiting exoplanets, we know if clouds are present because they mute spectral features and cause wavelength-dependent scattering. While the exact composition of these clouds is largely unknown, this information is vital to understanding the chemistry and energy budget of planetary atmospheres. In this work, we observe one transit of the hot Jupiter WASP-17b with JWST's MIRI LRS and generate a transmission spectrum from 5-12 \${\textbackslash}rm\{{\textbackslash}mu\}\$m. These wavelengths allow us to probe absorption due to the vibrational modes of various predicted cloud species. Our transmission spectrum shows additional opacity centered at 8.6 \${\textbackslash}rm\{{\textbackslash}mu\}\$m, and detailed atmospheric modeling and retrievals identify this feature as SiO\$\_2\$(s) (quartz) clouds. The SiO\$\_2\$(s) clouds model is preferred at 3.5-4.2\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ versus a cloud-free model and at 2.6\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ versus a generic aerosol prescription. We find the SiO\$\_2\$(s) clouds are comprised of small \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\}0.01\$ \${\textbackslash}rm\{{\textbackslash}mu\}\$m particles, which extend to high altitudes in the atmosphere. The atmosphere also shows a depletion of H\$\_2\$O, a finding consistent with the formation of high-temperature aerosols from oxygen-rich species.

The ﬁnding that the mini-Neptune K2-18b could host a liquid water ocean beneath a mostly hydrogen envelope motivates a detailed examination of the phase structures of water-rich planets. To this end, we present new internal structure models for super-Earths and mini-Neptunes that enable detailed characterization of a planet’s water component. We use our models to explore the possible phase structures of water worlds and ﬁnd that a diverse range of interiors are possible, from oceans sandwiched between two layers of ice to supercritical interiors beneath steam atmospheres. We determine how the bulk properties and surface conditions of a water world affect its ocean depth, ﬁnding that oceans can be up to hundreds of times deeper than on Earth. For example, a planet with a 300 K surface can possess H2O oceans with depths from 30–500 km, depending on its mass and composition. We also constrain the region of mass–radius space in which planets with H/He envelopes could host liquid H2O, noting that the liquid phase can persist at temperatures up to 647 K at high pressures of 218–7 × 104 bar. Such H/He envelopes could contribute signiﬁcantly to the planet radius while retaining liquid water at the surface, depending on the planet mass and temperature proﬁle. Our ﬁndings highlight the exciting possibility that habitable conditions may be present on planets much larger than Earth.},

The small stellar radius amplifies the atmospheric transit signature, making even compact secondary atmospheres dominated by N2 or CO2 amenable to characterization with existing instrumentation1. Yet, despite large planet search efforts2, detection of low-temperature Earth-sized planets around late-M dwarfs has remained rare and the TRAPPIST-1 system, a resonance chain of rocky planets with seemingly identical compositions, has not yet shown any evidence of volatiles in the system3. Here we report the discovery of a temperate Earth-sized planet orbiting the cool M6 dwarf LP 791-18. The newly discovered planet, LP 791-18d, has a radius of 1.03 ± 0.04 R⊕ and an equilibrium temperature of 300–400 K, with the permanent night side plausibly allowing for water condensation. LP 791-18d is part of a coplanar system4 and provides a so-far unique opportunity to investigate a temperate exo-Earth in a system with a sub-Neptune that retained its gas or volatile envelope. On the basis of observations of transit timing variations, we find a mass of 7.1 ± 0.7 M⊕ for the sub-Neptune LP 791-18c and a mass of \$\$\{0.9\}\_\{-0.4\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.5\}\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus \}\$\$for the exo-Earth LP 791-18d. The gravitational interaction with the sub-Neptune prevents the complete circularization of LP 791-18d’s orbit, resulting in continued tidal heating of LP 791-18d’s interior and probably strong volcanic activity at the surface5,6.},

	abstract = {We use thermochemical equilibrium calculations to model iron, magnesium, and silicon chemistry in the atmospheres of giant planets, brown dwarfs, extrasolar giant planets (EGPs), and low-mass stars. The behavior of individual Fe-, Mg-, and Si-bearing gases and condensates is determined as a function of temperature, pressure, and metallicity. Our results are thus independent of any particular model atmosphere. The condensation of Fe metal strongly affects iron chemistry by efficiently removing Fe-bearing species from the gas phase. Monatomic Fe is the most abundant Fe-bearing gas throughout the atmospheres of EGPs and L dwarfs and in the deep atmospheres of giant planets and T dwarfs. Mg- and Si-bearing gases are effectively removed from the atmosphere by forsterite (Mg2SiO4) and enstatite (MgSiO3) cloud formation. Monatomic Mg is the dominant magnesium gas throughout the atmospheres of EGPs and L dwarfs and in the deep atmospheres of giant planets and T dwarfs. Silicon monoxide (SiO) is the most abundant Si-bearing gas in the deep atmospheres of brown dwarfs and EGPs, whereas SiH4 is dominant in the deep atmosphere of Jupiter and other gas giant planets. Several other Fe-, Mg-, and Si-bearing gases become increasingly important with decreasing effective temperature. In principle, a number of Fe, Mg, and Si gases are potential tracers of weather or diagnostic of temperature in substellar atmospheres.},

	abstract = {Most brown dwarfs have atmospheres with temperatures cold enough to form clouds. A variety of materials likely condense, including refractory metal oxides and silicates; the precise compositions and crystal structures of predicted cloud particles depend on the modeling framework used and have not yet been empirically constrained. Spitzer has shown tentative evidence of the silicate feature in L dwarf spectra and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) can measure these features in many L dwarfs. Here, we present new models to predict the signatures of the strongest cloud absorption features. We investigate different cloud mineral species and determine how particle size, mineralogy, and crystalline structure change spectral features. We find that silicate and refractory clouds have a strong cloud absorption feature for small particle sizes (≤1 μm). Model spectra are compared to five brown dwarfs that show evidence of the silicate feature; models that include small particles in the upper layers of the atmosphere produce a broad cloud mineral feature, and that better match the observed spectra than the Ackerman \& Marley cloud model. We simulate observations with the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) instrument on JWST for a range of nearby, cloudy brown dwarfs, demonstrating that these features could be readily detectable if small particles are present. Furthermore, for photometrically variable brown dwarfs, our predictions suggest that with JWST, by measuring spectroscopic variability inside and outside a mineral feature, we can establish silicate (or other) clouds as the cause of variability. Mid-infrared spectroscopy is a promising tool to empirically constrain the complex cloud condensation sequence in brown dwarf atmospheres.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
            We present a uniform analysis of all mid-infrared R ≈ 90 spectra of field M5–T9 dwarfs obtained with the Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph (IRS). The sample contains 113 spectra out of which 12 belong to late-M dwarfs, 69 to L dwarfs, and 32 to T dwarfs. Sixty-eight of these spectra are presented for the first time. We measure strengths of the main absorption bands in the IRS spectra, namely H2O at 6.25 \${\textbackslash}rm\{{\textbackslash}mu m\}\$, CH4 at 7.65 \${\textbackslash}rm\{{\textbackslash}mu m\}\$, NH3 at 10.5 \${\textbackslash}rm\{{\textbackslash}mu m\}\$, and silicates over 8–11 \${\textbackslash}rm\{{\textbackslash}mu m\}\$. Water absorption is present in all spectra and strengthens with spectral type. The onset of methane and ammonia occurs at the L8 and T2.5 types, respectively, although ammonia can be detectable as early as T1.5. Silicate absorption sets in at spectral type L2, is on average the strongest in L4–L6 dwarfs, and disappears past L8. However, silicate absorption can also be absent from the spectra at any L subtype. We find a positive correlation between the silicate absorption strength and the excess (deviation from median) near-infrared colour at a given L subtype, which supports the idea that variations of silicate cloud thickness produce the observed colour scatter in L dwarfs. We also find that variable L3–L7 dwarfs are twice more likely to have above-average silicate absorption than non-variables. The ensemble of results solidifies the evidence for silicate condensate clouds in the atmospheres of L dwarfs, and for the first time observationally establishes their emergence and sedimentation between effective temperatures of ≈2000 and ≈1300 K, respectively.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
            Analysis of all archival 5–14 micron spectra of field ultracool dwarfs from the Infrared Spectrograph on the Spitzer Space Telescope has shown that absorption by silicates in the 8–11 micron region is seen in most L-type (1300 to 2200 K) dwarfs. The absorption is caused by silicate-rich clouds in the atmospheres of L dwarfs and is strongest at L4–L6 spectral types. Herein we compare averages of the mid-infrared silicate absorption signatures of L3–L7 dwarfs that have low (≲104.5 cm s−2) versus high (≳105 cm s−2) surface gravity. We find that the silicate absorption feature is sensitive to surface gravity, with young atmospheres having a broader, redder, and more asymmetric absorption profile. This indicates a difference in grain size and composition between dust condensates in young and old mid-L dwarfs. The mean silicate absorption profile of low-gravity mid-L dwarfs matches expectations for ∼1 micron-sized amorphous iron- and magnesium-bearing pyroxene (MgxFe1 − xSiO3) grains. High-gravity mid-L dwarfs have silicate absorption better represented by smaller (≲0.1 μm) and more volatile amorphous enstatite (MgSiO3) or SiO grains. This is the first direct spectroscopic evidence for gravity-dependent sedimentation of dust condensates in ultracool atmospheres. It confirms theoretical expectations for lower sedimentation efficiencies in low-gravity atmospheres and independently confirms their increased dustiness.},

	abstract = {Seven rocky planets orbit the nearby dwarf star TRAPPIST-1, providing a unique opportunity to search for atmospheres on small planets outside the Solar System1. Thanks to the recent launch of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), possible atmospheric constituents such as carbon dioxide (CO2) are now detectable2,3. Recent JWST observations of the innermost planet TRAPPIST-1 b showed that it is most probably a bare rock without any CO2 in its atmosphere4. Here we report the detection of thermal emission from the dayside of TRAPPIST-1 c with the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on JWST at 15 µm. We measure a planet-to-star flux ratio of fp/f⁎ = 421 ± 94 parts per million (ppm), which corresponds to an inferred dayside brightness temperature of 380 ± 31 K. This high dayside temperature disfavours a thick, CO2-rich atmosphere on the planet. The data rule out cloud-free O2/CO2 mixtures with surface pressures ranging from 10 bar (with 10 ppm CO2) to 0.1 bar (pure CO2). A Venus-analogue atmosphere with sulfuric acid clouds is also disfavoured at 2.6σ confidence. Thinner atmospheres or bare-rock surfaces are consistent with our measured planet-to-star flux ratio. The absence of a thick, CO2-rich atmosphere on TRAPPIST-1 c suggests a relatively volatile-poor formation history, with less than \$\$\{9.5\}\_\{-2.3\}{\textasciicircum}\{+7.5\}\$\$Earth oceans of water. If all planets in the system formed in the same way, this would indicate a limited reservoir of volatiles for the potentially habitable planets in the system.},

	abstract = {Neptune-sized planets exhibit a wide range of compositions and densities, depending on factors related to their formation and evolution history, such as the distance from their host stars and atmospheric escape processes. They can vary from relatively low-density planets with thick hydrogen–helium atmospheres1,2 to higher-density planets with a substantial amount of water or a rocky interior with a thinner atmosphere, such as HD 95338 b (ref. 3), TOI-849 b (ref. 4) and TOI-2196 b (ref. 5). The discovery of exoplanets in the hot-Neptune desert6, a region close to the host stars with a deficit of Neptune-sized planets, provides insights into the formation and evolution of planetary systems, including the existence of this region itself. Here we show observations of the transiting planet TOI-1853 b, which has a radius of 3.46 ± 0.08 Earth radii and orbits a dwarf star every 1.24 days. This planet has a mass of 73.2 ± 2.7 Earth masses, almost twice that of any other Neptune-sized planet known so far, and a density of 9.7 ± 0.8 grams per cubic centimetre. These values place TOI-1853 b in the middle of the Neptunian desert and imply that heavy elements dominate its mass. The properties of TOI-1853 b present a puzzle for conventional theories of planetary formation and evolution, and could be the result of several proto-planet collisions or the final state of an initially high-eccentricity planet that migrated closer to its parent star.},

	abstract = {Super-Earths span a wide range of bulk densities, indicating a diversity in interior conditions beyond that seen in the solar system. In particular, an emerging population of low-density super-Earths may be explained by volatile-rich interiors. Among these, low-density lava worlds have dayside temperatures that are high enough to evaporate their surfaces, providing a unique opportunity to probe their interior compositions and test for the presence of volatiles. In this work, we investigate the atmospheric observability of low-density lava worlds. We use a radiative-convective model to explore the atmospheric structures and emission spectra of these planets, focusing on three case studies with high observability metrics and substellar temperatures spanning ∼1900–2800 K: HD 86226 c, HD 3167 b, and 55 Cnc e. Given the possibility of mixed volatile and silicate interior compositions for these planets, we consider a range of mixed volatile and rock-vapor atmospheric compositions. This includes a range of volatile fractions and three volatile compositions: water-rich (100\% H2O), water with CO2 (80\% H2O+20\% CO2), and a desiccated O-rich scenario (67\% O2+33\% CO2). We find that spectral features due to H2O, CO2, SiO, and SiO2 are present in the infrared emission spectra as either emission or absorption features, depending on dayside temperature, volatile fraction, and volatile composition. We further simulate JWST secondary-eclipse observations for each of the three case studies, finding that H2O and/or CO2 could be detected with as few as ∼five eclipses. Detecting volatiles in these atmospheres would provide crucial independent evidence that volatile-rich interiors exist among the super-Earth population.},

Assembling such a sample requires confirming hundreds of planet candidates with additional follow-up observations. Here we present 20 hot Jupiters that were detected using TESS data and confirmed to be planets through photometric, spectroscopic, and imaging observations coordinated by the TESS Follow-up Observing Program. These 20 planets have orbital periods shorter than 7 days and orbit relatively bright FGK stars (10.9 {\textless} G {\textless} 13.0). Most of the planets are comparable in mass to Jupiter, although there are four planets with masses less than that of Saturn. TOI-3976b, the longest-period planet in our sample (P = 6.6 days), may be on a moderately eccentric orbit (e = 0.18 ± 0.06), while observations of the other targets are consistent with them being on circular orbits. We measured the projected stellar obliquity of TOI-1937A b, a hot Jupiter on a 22.4 hr orbit with the Rossiter–McLaughlin effect, finding the planet’s orbit to be well aligned with the stellar spin axis (∣λ∣ = 4.°0 ± 3.°5). We also investigated the possibility that TOI-1937 is a member of the NGC 2516 open cluster but ultimately found the evidence for cluster membership to be ambiguous. These objects are part of a larger effort to build a complete sample of hot Jupiters to be used for future demographic and detailed characterization work.},

	abstract = {The near-infrared transmission spectrum of the warm sub-Neptune exoplanet GJ 1214 b has been observed to be flat and featureless, implying a high metallicity atmosphere with abundant aerosols. Recent JWST MIRI Low Resolution Spectrometer observations of a phase curve of GJ 1214 b showed that its transmission spectrum is flat out into the mid-infrared. In this paper, we use the combined near- and mid-infrared transmission spectrum of GJ 1214 b to constrain its atmospheric composition and aerosol properties. We generate a grid of photochemical haze models using an aerosol microphysics code for a number of background atmospheres spanning metallicities from 100 to 1000× solar, as well as a steam atmosphere scenario. The flatness of the combined data set largely rules out atmospheric metallicities ≤300× solar due to their large corresponding molecular feature amplitudes, preferring values ≥1000× solar and column haze production rates ≥10−10 g cm−2 s−1. The steam atmosphere scenario with similarly high haze production rates also exhibits sufficiently small molecular features to be consistent with the transmission spectrum. These compositions imply that atmospheric mean molecular weights ≥15 g mol−1 are needed to fit the data. Our results suggest that haze production is highly efficient on GJ 1214 b and could involve non-hydrocarbon, non-nitrogen haze precursors. Further characterization of GJ 1214 b’s atmosphere would likely require multiple transits and eclipses using JWST across the near- and mid-infrared, potentially complemented by ground-based high-resolution transmission spectroscopy.},

The chemical inventory of hot Jupiter (HJ) exoplanet atmospheres continues to be observed by various ground- and space-based instruments in increasing detail and precision. It is expected for some HJs to exhibit strong non-equilibrium chemistry characteristics in their atmospheres, which might be inferred from spectral observations.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims{\textless}i/{\textgreater}. We aim to model the 3D thermochemical non-equilibrium chemistry in the atmospheres of the HJs WASP-39b and HD 189733b.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods{\textless}i/{\textgreater}. We coupled a lightweight, reduced chemical network ‘mini-chem’ that utilises net reaction rate tables to the Exo-FMS general circulation model (GCM). We performed GCM models of the exoplanets WASP-39b and HD 189733b as case studies of the coupled mini-chem scheme. The GCM results were then post-processed using the 3D radiative-transfer model gCMCRT to produce transmission and emission spectra to assess the impact of non-equilibrium chemistry on their observable properties.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results{\textless}i/{\textgreater}. Both simulations show significant departures from chemical equilibrium (CE) due to the dynamical motions of the atmosphere. The spacial distribution of species generally closely follows the dynamical features of the atmosphere rather than the temperature field. Each molecular species exhibits a different quench level in the simulations, which is also dependent on the latitude of the planet. Major differences are seen in the transmission and emission spectral features between the CE and kinetic models.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions{\textless}i/{\textgreater}. Our simulations indicate that considering the 3D kinetic chemical structures of HJ atmospheres has an important impact on the physical interpretation of observational data. Drawing bulk atmospheric parameters from fitting feature strengths may lead to an inaccurate interpretation of chemical conditions in the atmosphere of HJs. Our open source mini-chem module is simple to couple with contemporary HJ GCM models without substantially increasing required computational resources.},

We analyze the masses and radii of all known small transiting planets around M dwarfs, identifying three populations: rocky, water-rich, and gas-rich. Our results are inconsistent with the previously known bimodal radius distribution arising from atmospheric loss of a hydrogen/helium envelope. Instead, we propose that a density gap separates rocky from water-rich exoplanets. Formation models that include orbital migration can explain the observations: Rocky planets form within the snow line, whereas water-rich worlds form outside it and later migrate inward.},

All stars were observed using the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory. Our procedure used a single line list to fit model spectra to observations of all stars to determine effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, projected rotational velocity, and the abundances of 15 elements (C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, and Y). Sixty percent of the sample had Hipparcos parallaxes and V-band photometry, which we combined with the spectroscopic results to obtain mass, radius, and luminosity. Additionally, we used the luminosity, effective temperature, metallicity and α-element enhancement to interpolate in the Yonsei–Yale isochrones to derive mass, radius, gravity, and age ranges for those stars. Finally, we determined new relations between effective temperature and macroturbulence for dwarfs and subgiants. Our analysis achieved precisions of 25 K in , 0.01 dex in [M/H], 0.028 dex for , and 0.5 km s−1 in based on multiple observations of the same stars. The abundance results were similarly precise, between ∼0.01 and ∼0.04 dex, though trends with respect to remained for which we derived empirical corrections. The trends, though small, were much larger than our uncertainties and are shared with published abundances. We show that changing our model atmosphere grid accounts for most of the trend in [M/H] between 5000 and 5500 K, indicating a possible problem with the atmosphere models or opacities.},

We present C/O and Mg/Si ratios for 852 F, G, and K dwarfs in the solar neighborhood. We find that the frequency of carbon-rich dwarfs in the solar neighborhood is and that 156 known planet hosts in the sample follow a similar distribution as all of the stars as a whole. The cosmic distribution of Mg/Si for these same stars is broader than the C/O distribution and peaks near 1.0, with of systems having Mg/Si , leading to rocky planet compositions similar to the Earth.

	abstract = {The search for habitable environments and biomarkers in exoplanetary atmospheres is the holy grail of exoplanet science. The detection of atmospheric signatures of habitable Earth-like exoplanets is challenging due to their small planet-star size contrast and thin atmospheres with high mean molecular weight. Recently, a new class of habitable exoplanets, called Hycean worlds, has been proposed, defined as temperate ocean-covered worlds with H2-rich atmospheres. Their large sizes and extended atmospheres, compared to rocky planets of the same mass, make Hycean worlds significantly more accessible to atmospheric spectroscopy with the JWST. Here we report a transmission spectrum of the candidate Hycean world, K2-18 b, observed with the JWST NIRISS and NIRSpec instruments in the 0.9-5.2 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m range. The spectrum reveals strong detections of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) at 5\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ and 3\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ confidence, respectively, with high volume mixing ratios of {\textasciitilde}1\% each in a H2-rich atmosphere. The abundant CH4 and CO2 along with the non-detection of ammonia (NH3) are consistent with chemical predictions for an ocean under a temperate H2-rich atmosphere on K2-18 b. The spectrum also suggests potential signs of dimethyl sulfide (DMS), which has been predicted to be an observable biomarker in Hycean worlds, motivating considerations of possible biological activity on the planet. The detection of CH4 resolves the long-standing missing methane problem for temperate exoplanets and the degeneracy in the atmospheric composition of K2-18 b from previous observations. We discuss possible implications of the findings, open questions, and future observations to explore this new regime in the search for life elsewhere.},

	abstract = {Hot Jupiters receive intense incident stellar light on their daysides, which drives vigorous atmospheric circulation that attempts to erase their large dayside-to-nightside flux contrasts. Propagating waves and instabilities in hot Jupiter atmospheres can cause emergent properties of the atmosphere to be time-variable. In this work, we study such weather in hot Jupiter atmospheres using idealized cloud-free general circulation models with double-gray radiative transfer. We find that hot Jupiter atmospheres can be time-variable at the ∼0.1\%–1\% level in globally averaged temperature and at the ∼1\%–10\% level in globally averaged wind speeds. As a result, we find that observable quantities are also time-variable: the secondary eclipse depth can be variable at the ≲2\% level, the phase-curve amplitude can change by ≲1\%, the phase-curve offset can shift by ≲5°, and terminator-averaged wind speeds can vary by ≲2 km s−1. Additionally, we calculate how the eastern and western limb-averaged wind speeds vary with incident stellar flux and the strength of an imposed drag that parameterizes Lorentz forces in partially ionized atmospheres. We find that the eastern limb is blueshifted in models over a wide range of equilibrium temperature and drag strength, while the western limb is only redshifted if equilibrium temperatures are ≲1500 K and drag is weak. Lastly, we show that temporal variability may be observationally detectable in the infrared through secondary eclipse observations with the James Webb Space Telescope, phase-curve observations with future space telescopes (e.g., ARIEL), and/or Doppler wind speed measurements with high-resolution spectrographs.},

Because of its broad wavelength coverage and improved resolution compared with previous instruments, spectroscopy with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) offers a new capability to detect and characterize the atmospheres of Earth-sized, M-dwarf planets. Here we use the JWST to independently validate the discovery of LHS 475 b, a warm (586 K), 0.99 Earth-radius exoplanet, interior to the habitable zone, and report a precise 2.9–5.3 μm transmission spectrum using the Near Infrared Spectrograph G395H instrument. With two transit observations, we rule out primordial hydrogen-dominated and cloudless pure methane atmospheres. Thus far, the featureless transmission spectrum remains consistent with a planet that has a high-altitude cloud deck (similar to Venus), a tenuous atmosphere (similar to Mars) or no appreciable atmosphere at all (akin to Mercury). There are no signs of stellar contamination due to spots or faculae. Our observations show that the JWST has the requisite sensitivity to constrain the secondary atmospheres of terrestrial exoplanets with absorption features {\textless}50 ppm, and that our current atmospheric constraints speak to the nature of the planet itself, rather than instrumental limits.},

The aCeTY line list covers the transition wavenumbers up to 10 000 cm−1 (λ \&gt; 1 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m), with lower and upper energy levels up to 12 000 and 22 000 cm−1 considered, respectively. The calculations are performed up to a maximum value for the vibrational angular momentum, Kmax = Lmax  =  16, and maximum rotational angular momentum, J = 99. Higher values of J were not within the specified wavenumber window. The aCeTY line list is considered to be complete up to 2200 K, making it suitable for use in characterizing high-temperature exoplanet or cool stellar atmospheres. Einstein-A coefficients, which can directly be used to calculate intensities at a particular temperature, are computed for 4.3 billion (4 347 381 911) transitions between 5 million (5 160 803) energy levels. We make comparisons against other available data for 12C2H2, and demonstrate this to be the most complete line list available. The line list is available in electronic form from the online CDS and ExoMol data bases.},

To create this compilation, ab initio line lists of 12CH4 from Rey et al. ApJ, 847, 105 (provided at separate temperatures in the TheoReTS information system), are now combined with HITRAN2016 methane data to produce a single line list suitable for high-temperature line-by-line calculations up to 2000 K. An effective-temperature interpolation model was created in order to represent continuum-like features over the temperature range of study. This model is advantageous to previously used approaches that employ so-called “super-lines,” which are suitable only at a given temperature and require separate line lists for different temperatures. The resultant HITEMP line list contains ∼32 million lines and is significantly more flexible than alternative line lists of methane, while accuracy required for astrophysical or combustion applications is retained. Comparisons against experimental observations of methane absorption at high temperatures have been used to demonstrate the accuracy of the new work. The line list includes both strong lines and quasi-continuum features and is provided in the common user-friendly HITRAN/HITEMP format, making it the most practical methane line list for radiative-transfer modeling at high-temperature conditions.},

The opacity in the red optical to near-IR region under these conditions is dominated by the extremely pressure-broadened wings of the alkali resonance lines, in particular, the K I resonance doublet at 0.77 µm. Collisions with H2 are preponderant in brown dwarf atmospheres at an eﬀective temperature of about 1000 K; the H2 perturber densities reach several 1019 even in Jupiter-mass planets and exceed 1020 for super-Jupiters and older Y dwarfs. As a consequence, it appears that when the far wing absorption due to alkali atoms in a dense H2 atmosphere is signiﬁcant, accurate pressure broadened proﬁles that are valid at high densities of H2 should be incorporated into spectral models.},

Here we present an analysis of this spectrum. We develop first-order equations to interpret absorption spectra. In the case of HD 189733b, we show that the observed slope of the absorption as a function of wavelength is characteristic of extinction proportional to the inverse of the fourth power of the wavelength (). Assuming an extinction dominated by Rayleigh scattering, we derive an atmospheric temperature of 1340 {\textless}i{\textgreater}±{\textless}i/{\textgreater} 150 K. If molecular hydrogen is responsible for the Rayleigh scattering, the atmospheric pressure at the planetary characteristic radius of 0.1564 stellar radius must be 410 {\textless}i{\textgreater}±{\textless}i/{\textgreater} 30 mbar. However the preferred scenario is scattering by condensate particles. Using the Mie approximation, we find that the particles must have a low value for the imaginary part of the refraction index. We identify MgSiO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}3{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} as a possible abundant condensate whose particle size must be between {\textasciitilde}10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-2{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} and {\textasciitilde}10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} {\textless}i{\textgreater}μ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}m. For this condensate, assuming solar abundance, the pressure at 0.1564 stellar radius is found to be between a few microbars and few millibars, and the temperature is found to be in the range 1340–1540 K, and both depend on the particle size.},

These typically vary a number of parameters linearly, containing one model for every combination of parameter values. Here we investigate alternative methods of sampling parameters, including random sampling and Latin hypercube (LH) sampling, and how these compare to linearly sampled grids. We use a random forest to analyze the performance of these grids for two different models, as well as investigate the information content of the particular model grid from Goyal et al. (2019). We also use nested sampling to implement mock atmospheric retrievals on simulated James Webb Space Telescope transmission spectra by interpolating on linearly sampled model grids. Our results show that random or LH sampling outperforms linear sampling in parameter predictability for our higher-dimensional models, requiring fewer models in the grid, and thus allowing for more computationally intensive forward models to be used. We also found that using a traditional retrieval with interpolation on a linear grid can produce biased posterior distributions, especially for parameters with nonlinear effects on the spectrum. In particular, we advise caution when performing linear interpolation on the C/O ratio, cloud properties, and metallicity. Finally, we found that the information content analysis of the grid from Goyal et al. (2019) was able to highlight key areas of the spectra where the presence or absence of certain molecules can be detected, providing good indicators for parameters such as temperature and C/O ratio.},

	abstract = {The atmosphere of a brown dwarf or extrasolar giant planet controls the spectrum of radiation emitted by the object and regulates its cooling over time. While the study of these atmospheres has been informed by decades of experience modeling stellar and planetary atmospheres, the distinctive characteristics of these objects present unique challenges to forward modeling. In particular, complex chemistry arising from molecule-rich atmospheres, molecular opacity line lists (sometimes running to 10 billion absorption lines or more) multiple cloud-forming condensates, and disequilibrium chemical processes all combine to create a challenging task for any modeling effort. This review describes the process of incorporating these complexities into one-dimensional radiative-convective equilibrium models of sub-stellar objects. We discuss the underlying mathematics as well as the techniques used to model the physics, chemistry, radiative transfer, and other processes relevant to understanding these atmospheres. The review focuses on the process of the creation of atmosphere models and briefly presents some comparisons of model predictions to data. Current challenges in the field and some comments on the future conclude the review.},

One of the first exoplanets observed by JWST in the summer of 2022 was WASP-96 b, a hot Saturn orbiting a G8 star. As a part of the Early Release Observations programme, one transit of WASP-96 b was observed with NIRISS/SOSS to capture its transmission spectrum from 0.6 to 2.85 μm. In this work, we utilize four retrieval frameworks to report precise and robust measurements of WASP-96 b’s atmospheric composition. We constrain the logarithmic volume mixing ratios of multiple chemical species in its atmosphere, including: H2O = \$-3.59 {\textasciicircum}\{+ 0.35 \}\_\{- 0.35 \}\$, CO2 = \$-4.38 {\textasciicircum}\{+ 0.47 \}\_\{- 0.57 \}\$, and K = \$-8.04 {\textasciicircum}\{+ 1.22 \}\_\{- 1.71 \}\$, thus generally consistent with 1× solar (with the exception of CO2). Notably, our results offer a first abundance constraint on potassium in WASP-96 b’s atmosphere and important inferences on carbon-bearing species such as CO2 and CO. Our short wavelength NIRISS/SOSS data are best explained by the presence of an enhanced Rayleigh scattering slope, despite previous inferences of a clear atmosphere – although we find no evidence for a grey cloud deck. Finally, we explore the data resolution required to appropriately interpret observations using NIRISS/SOSS. We find that our inferences are robust against different binning schemes. That is, from low R = 125 to the native resolution of the instrument, the bulk atmospheric properties of the planet are consistent. Our systematic analysis of these exquisite observations demonstrates the power of NIRISS/SOSS to detect and constrain multiple molecular and atomic species in the atmospheres of hot giant planets.},

	abstract = {We present JWST Early Release Science coronagraphic observations of the super-Jupiter exoplanet, HIP 65426b, with the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) from 2 to 5 μm, and with the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) from 11 to 16 μm. At a separation of ∼0.″82 (87 au), HIP 65426b is clearly detected in all seven of our observational filters, representing the first images of an exoplanet to be obtained by JWST, and the first-ever direct detection of an exoplanet beyond 5 μm. These observations demonstrate that JWST is exceeding its nominal predicted performance by up to a factor of 10, depending on separation and subtraction method, with measured 5σ contrast limits of ∼1 × 10−5 and ∼2 × 10−4 at 1″ for NIRCam at 4.4 μm and MIRI at 11.3 μm, respectively. These contrast limits provide sensitivity to sub-Jupiter companions with masses as low as 0.3M Jup beyond separations of ∼100 au. Together with existing ground-based near-infrared data, the JWST photometry are fit well by a BT-SETTL atmospheric model from 1 to 16 μm, and they span ∼97\% of HIP 65426b's luminous range. Independent of the choice of model atmosphere, we measure an empirical bolometric luminosity that is tightly constrained between = −4.31 and −4.14, which in turn provides a robust mass constraint of 7.1 ± 1.2 M Jup. In totality, these observations confirm that JWST presents a powerful and exciting opportunity to characterize the population of exoplanets amenable to high-contrast imaging in greater detail.},

	abstract = {About 70\%–80\% of stars in our solar and Galactic neighborhood are M dwarfs. They span a range of low masses and temperatures relative to solar-type stars, facilitating molecule formation throughout their atmospheres. Standard stellar atmosphere models primarily designed for FGK stars face challenges when characterizing broadband molecular features in spectra of cool stars. Here, we introduce SPHINX—a new 1D self-consistent radiative–convective thermochemical equilibrium chemistry model grid of atmospheres and spectra for M dwarfs in low resolution (R ∼ 250). We incorporate the latest precomputed absorption cross sections with pressure broadening for key molecules dominant in late-K, early/main-sequence-M stars. We then validate our grid models by determining fundamental properties (T eff, log g, [M/H], radius, and C/O) for 10 benchmark M+G binary stars with known host metallicities and 10 M dwarfs with interferometrically measured angular diameters. Incorporating the Gaussian process inference tool Starfish, we account for correlated and systematic noise in low-resolution (spectral stitching of SpeX, SNIFS, and STIS) observations and derive robust estimates of fundamental M-dwarf atmospheric parameters. Additionally, we assess the influence of photospheric heterogeneity on inferred [M/H] and find that it could explain some deviations from observations. We also probe whether the adopted convective mixing length parameter influences inferred radii, effective temperature, and [M/H] and again find that may explain discrepancies between interferometric observations and model-derived parameters for cooler M dwarfs. Mainly, we show the unique strength in leveraging broadband molecular absorption features occurring in low-resolution M dwarf spectra and demonstrate the ability to improve constraints on fundamental properties of exoplanet hosts and brown-dwarf companions.},

We measure a radial projection of the Keplerian velocity, KP, of 148 ± 7 km s−1, consistent with transit measurements, and detect water vapor at 3.8σ. We combine NIRSPEC L-band data with Spitzer IRAC secondary eclipse data to further probe the metallicity and carbon-to-oxygen ratio of KELT-2Ab’s atmosphere. While the NIRSPEC analysis provides few extra constraints on the Spitzer data, it does provide roughly the same constraints on metallicity and carbon-to-oxygen ratio. This bodes well for future investigations of the atmospheres of non-transiting hot Jupiters.},

In this study, we identify what can unambiguously be determined about the atmospheres of exoplanets from their transmission spectra by applying the retrieval method to synthetic observations of the super-Earth GJ 1214b. Our approach to inferring constraints on atmospheric parameters is to compute their joint and marginal posterior probability distributions using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique in a parallel tempering scheme. A new atmospheric parameterization is introduced that is applicable to general atmospheres in which the main constituent is not known a priori and clouds may be present. Our main finding is that a unique constraint of the mixing ratios of the absorbers and two spectrally inactive gases (such as N2 and primordial H2+ He) is possible if the observations are sufficient to quantify both (1) the broadband transit depths in at least one absorption feature for each absorber and (2) the slope and strength of the molecular Rayleigh scattering signature. A second finding is that the surface pressure or cloud-top pressure can be quantified if a surface or cloud deck is present at low optical depth. A third finding is that the mean molecular mass can be constrained by measuring either the Rayleigh scattering slope or the shapes of the absorption features, thus enabling one to distinguish between cloudy hydrogen-rich atmospheres and high mean molecular mass atmospheres. We conclude, however, that without the signature of molecular Rayleigh scattering—even with robustly detected infrared absorption features ({\textgreater}10σ)—there is no reliable way to tell from the transmission spectrum whether the absorber is a main constituent of the atmosphere or just a minor species with a mixing ratio of Xabs {\textless} 0.1\%. The retrieval method leads us to a conceptual picture of which details in transmission spectra are essential for unique characterizations of well-mixed exoplanet atmospheres.},

	abstract = {The complexity of atmospheric retrieval models is largely data-driven, and one-dimensional models have generally been considered adequate with current data quality. However, recent studies have suggested that using 1D models in retrievals can result in anomalously cool terminator temperatures and biased abundance estimates even with existing transmission spectra of hot Jupiters. Motivated by these claims and upcoming high-quality transmission spectra, we systematically explore the limitations of 1D models using synthetic and current observations. We use 1D models of varying complexity, both analytic and numerical, to revisit claims of biases when interpreting transmission spectra of hot Jupiters with inhomogeneous terminator compositions. Overall, we find the reported biases to be resulting from specific model assumptions rather than intrinsic limitations of 1D atmospheric models in retrieving current observations of asymmetric terminators. Additionally, we revise atmospheric retrievals of the hot Jupiter WASP-43b (T eq = 1440 K) and the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-103b (T eq = 2484 K), for which previous studies inferred abnormally cool atmospheric temperatures. We retrieve temperatures consistent with expectations. We note, however, that in the limit of extreme terminator inhomogeneities and high data quality, some atmospheric inferences may conceivably be biased—although to a lesser extent than previously claimed. To address such cases, we implement a 2D retrieval framework for transmission spectra that allows accurate constraints on average atmospheric properties and provides insights into the spectral ranges where the imprints of atmospheric inhomogeneities are strongest. Our study highlights the need for careful considerations of model assumptions and data quality before attributing biases in retrieved estimates to unaccounted atmospheric inhomogeneities.},

Transit observations of the super-Earth GJ 1214b rule out cloud-free H2-dominated scenarios, but are not able to determine whether the lack of deep spectral features is due to high-altitude clouds or the presence of a high mean molecular mass atmosphere. Here, we demonstrate that one can unambiguously distinguish between cloudy mini-Neptunes and volatile-dominated worlds based on wing steepness and relative depths of absorption features in moderate-resolution near-infrared transmission spectra (R ∼ 100). In a numerical retrieval study, we show for GJ 1214b that an unambiguous distinction between a cloudy H2-dominated atmosphere and cloud-free H2O atmosphere will be possible if the uncertainties in the spectral transit depth measurements can be reduced by a factor of ∼3 compared to the published Hubble Space Telescope Wide-Field Camera 3 and Very Large Telescope transit observations by Berta et al. and Bean et al. We argue that the required precision for the distinction may be achievable with currently available instrumentation by stacking 10–15 repeated transit observations. We provide a scaling law that scales our quantitative results to other transiting super-Earths and Neptunes such as HD 97658b, 55 Cnc e, GJ 3470b and GJ 436b. The analysis in this work is performed using an improved version of our Bayesian atmospheric retrieval framework. The new framework not only constrains the gas composition and cloud/haze parameters, but also determines our confidence in having detected molecules and cloud/haze species through Bayesian model comparison. Using the Bayesian tool, we demonstrate quantitatively that the subtle transit depth variation in the Berta et al. data is not sufficient to claim the detection of water absorption.},

	abstract = {Over the last decade exoplanetary transmission spectra have yielded an unprecedented understanding about the physical and chemical nature of planets outside our solar system. Physical and chemical knowledge is mainly extracted via fitting competing models to spectroscopic data, based on some goodness-of-fit metric. However, current employed metrics shed little light on how exactly a given model is failing at the individual data point level and where it could be improved. As the quality of our data and complexity of our models increases, there is a need to better understand which observations are driving our model interpretations. Here we present the application of Bayesian leave-one-out cross-validation to assess the performance of exoplanet atmospheric models and compute the expected log pointwise predictive density (elpdLOO). elpdLOO estimates the out-of-sample predictive accuracy of an atmospheric model at data-point resolution, providing interpretable model criticism. We introduce and demonstrate this method on synthetic Hubble Space Telescope transmission spectra of a hot Jupiter. We apply elpdLOO to interpret current observations of HAT-P-41 b and assess the reliability of recent inferences of H− in its atmosphere. We find that previous detections of H− are dependent solely on a single data point. This new metric for exoplanetary retrievals complements and expands our repertoire of tools to better understand the limits of our models and data. elpdLOO provides the means to interrogate models at the single-data-point level, which will help in robustly interpreting the imminent wealth of spectroscopic information coming from JWST.},

	abstract = {We present a new method to retrieve molecular abundances and temperature profiles from exoplanet atmosphere photometry and spectroscopy. We run millions of one-dimensional (1D) atmosphere models in order to cover the large range of allowed parameter space. In order to run such a large number of models, we have developed a parametric pressure–temperature (P–T) profile coupled with line-by-line radiative transfer, hydrostatic equilibrium, and energy balance, along with prescriptions for non-equilibrium molecular composition and energy redistribution. The major difference from traditional 1D radiative transfer models is the parametric P–T profile, which essentially means adopting energy balance only at the top of the atmosphere and not in each layer. We see the parametric P–T model as a parallel approach to the traditional exoplanet atmosphere models that rely on several free parameters to encompass unknown absorbers and energy redistribution. The parametric P–T profile captures the basic physical features of temperature structures in planetary atmospheres (including temperature inversions), and fits a wide range of published P–T profiles, including those of solar system planets. We apply our temperature and abundance retrieval method to the atmospheres of two transiting exoplanets, HD 189733b and HD 209458b, which have the best Spitzer and Hubble Space Telescope data available. For HD 189733b, we find efficient day–night redistribution of energy in the atmosphere, and molecular abundance constraints confirming the presence of H2O, CO, CH4, and CO2. For HD 209458b, we confirm and constrain the dayside thermal inversion in an average 1D temperature profile. We also report independent detections of H2O, CO, CH4, and CO2 on the dayside of HD 209458b, based on six-channel Spitzer photometry. We report constraints for HD 189733b due to individual data sets separately; a few key observations are variable in different data sets at similar wavelengths. Moreover, a noticeably strong CO2 absorption in one data set is significantly weaker in another. We must, therefore, acknowledge the strong possibility that the atmosphere is variable, both in its energy redistribution state and in the chemical abundances.},

	abstract = {Exoplanetary atmospheric retrieval refers to the inference of atmospheric properties of an exoplanet given an observed spectrum. The atmospheric properties include the chemical compositions, temperature profiles, clouds/hazes, and energy circulation. These properties, in turn, can provide key insights into the atmospheric physicochemical processes of exoplanets as well as their formation mechanisms. Major advancements in atmospheric retrieval have been made in the last decade, thanks to a combination of state-of-the-art spectroscopic observations and advanced atmospheric modeling and statistical inference methods. These developments have already resulted in key constraints on the atmospheric H2O abundances, temperature profiles, and other properties for several exoplanets. Upcoming facilities such as the JWST will further advance this area. The present chapter is a pedagogical review of this exciting frontier of exoplanetary science. The principles of atmospheric retrievals of exoplanets are discussed in detail, including parametric models and statistical inference methods, along with a review of key results in the field. Some of the main challenges in retrievals with current observations are discussed along with new directions and the future landscape.},

It is expected that, like all the planetary bodies in our solar system, exoplanet atmospheres will also have substantial cloud coverage, and evidence is mounting for clouds in a number of hot Jupiters. To better characterise planetary atmospheres, we need to consider the eﬀects these clouds will have on the observed broadband transmission spectra. Here we examine the expected cloud condensate species for hot Jupiter exoplanets and the eﬀects of various grain sizes and distributions on the resulting transmission spectra from the optical to infrared, which can be used as a broad framework when interpreting exoplanet spectra. We note that signiﬁcant infrared absorption features appear in the computed transmission spectrum, the result of vibrational modes between the key species in each condensate, which can potentially be very constraining. While it may be hard to diﬀerentiate between individual condensates in the broad transmission spectra, it may be possible to discern diﬀerent vibrational bonds, which can distinguish between cloud formation scenarios, such as condensate clouds or photochemically generated species. Vibrational mode features are shown to be prominent when the clouds are composed of small sub-micron sized particles and can be associated with an accompanying optical scattering slope. These infrared features have potential implications for future exoplanetary atmosphere studies conducted with JWST, where such vibrational modes distinguishing condensate species can be probed at longer wavelengths.},

	abstract = {Transmission spectra of exoplanetary atmospheres have been used to infer the presence of clouds/hazes. Such inferences are typically based on spectral slopes in the optical deviant from gaseous Rayleigh scattering or low-amplitude spectral features in the infrared. We investigate three observable metrics that could allow constraints on cloud properties from transmission spectra, namely the optical slope, the uniformity of this slope and condensate features in the infrared. We derive these metrics using model transmission spectra considering Mie extinction from a wide range of condensate species, particle sizes and scaleheights. First, we investigate possible degeneracies among the cloud properties for an observed slope. We ﬁnd, for example, that spectra with very steep optical slopes suggest sulphide clouds (e.g. MnS, ZnS, Na2S) in the atmospheres. Secondly, (non)uniformities in optical slopes provide additional constraints on cloud properties, e.g. MnS, ZnS, TiO2 and Fe2O3 have signiﬁcantly non-uniform slopes. Thirdly, infrared spectra provide an additional powerful probe into cloud properties, with SiO2, Fe2O3, Mg2SiO4 and MgSiO3 bearing strong infrared features observable with James Webb Space Telescope. We investigate observed spectra of eight hot Jupiters and discuss their implications. In particular, no single or composite condensate species considered here conforms to the steep and non-uniform optical slope observed for HD 189733b. Our work highlights the importance of the three above metrics to investigate cloud properties in exoplanetary atmospheres using high-precision transmission spectra and detailed cloud models.

	abstract = {We homogeneously analyse ∼3.2 × 105 photometric measurements for ∼1100 transit light curves belonging to 17 exoplanet hosts. The photometric data cover 16 years (2004–2019) and include amateur and professional observations. Old archival light curves were reprocessed using up-to-date exoplanetary parameters and empirically debiased limb-darkening models. We also derive self-consistent transit and radial-velocity ﬁts for 13 targets. We conﬁrm the nonlinear transit timing variation (TTV) trend in the WASP-12 data at a high signiﬁcance, and with a consistent magnitude. However, Doppler data reveal hints of a radial acceleration of about −7.5 ± 2.2 m s−1 yr−1, indicating the presence of unseen distant companions, and suggesting that roughly 10 per cent of the observed TTV was induced via the light-travel (or Roemer) effect. For WASP-4, a similar TTV trend suspected after the recent TESS observations appears controversial and model dependent. It is not supported by our homogeneous TTV sample, including 10 ground-based EXPANSION light curves obtained in 2018 simultaneously with TESS. Even if the TTV trend itself does exist in WASP-4, its magnitude and tidal nature are uncertain. Doppler data cannot entirely rule out the Roemer effect induced by possible distant companions.},

	abstract = {We show that the gas giant exoplanet HD 189733b is less oblate than Saturn, based on Spitzer Space Telescope photometry of seven transits. The observable manifestations of oblatenesswould have been slight anomalies during the ingress and egress phases, as well as variations in the transit depth due to spin precession. Our nondetection of these effects gives the first empirical constraints on the shape of an exoplanet. The results are consistent with the theoretical expectation that the planetary rotation period and orbital period are synchronized, in which case the oblateness would be an order of magnitude smaller than our upper limits. Conversely, if HD 189733b is assumed to be in a synchronous, zero-obliquity state, then the data give an upper bound on the quadrupole moment of the planet (J2 {\textless} 0.068 with 95\% confidence) that is too weak to constrain the interior structure of the planet. An Appendix describes a fast algorithm for computing the transit light curve of an oblate planet, which was necessary for our analysis.},

	abstract = {\${\textbackslash}texttt\{Eureka!\}\$ is a data reduction and analysis pipeline for exoplanet time-series observations, with a particular focus on JWST data. Over the next 1-2 decades, JWST will pursue four main science themes: Early Universe, Galaxies Over Time, Star Lifecycle, and Other Worlds. Our focus is on providing the astronomy community with an open source tool for the reduction and analysis of time-series observations of exoplanets in pursuit of the fourth of these themes, Other Worlds. The goal of \${\textbackslash}texttt\{Eureka!\}\$ is to provide an end-to-end pipeline that starts with uncalibrated FITS files and ultimately yields precise exoplanet spectra. The pipeline has a modular structure with six stages, and each stage uses a "Eureka! Control File" (ECF) to allow for easy control of the pipeline's behavior. Stage 5 also uses a "Eureka! Parameter File" (EPF) to control the fitted parameters. We provide template ECFs for the MIRI, NIRCam, NIRISS, and NIRSpec instruments on JWST and the WFC3 instrument on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). These templates give users a good starting point for their analyses, but \${\textbackslash}texttt\{Eureka!\}\$ is not intended to be used as a black box tool, and users should expect to fine-tune some settings for each observation in order to achieve optimal results. At each stage, the pipeline creates intermediate figures and outputs that allow users to compare \${\textbackslash}texttt\{Eureka!\}\$'s performance using different parameter settings or to compare \${\textbackslash}texttt\{Eureka!\}\$ with an independent pipeline. The ECF used to run each stage is also copied into the output folder from each stage to enhance reproducibility. Finally, while \${\textbackslash}texttt\{Eureka!\}\$ has been optimized for exoplanet observations (especially the latter stages of the code), much of the core functionality could also be repurposed for JWST time-series observations in other research domains thanks to \${\textbackslash}texttt\{Eureka!\}\$'s modularity.},

	abstract = {There are no planets intermediate in size between Earth and Neptune in our Solar System, yet these objects are found around a substantial fraction of other stars. Population statistics show that close-in planets in this size range bifurcate into two classes based on their radii. It is hypothesized that the group with larger radii (referred to as "sub-Neptunes") is distinguished by having hydrogen-dominated atmospheres that are a few percent of the total mass of the planets. GJ 1214b is an archetype sub-Neptune that has been observed extensively using transmission spectroscopy to test this hypothesis. However, the measured spectra are featureless, and thus inconclusive, due to the presence of high-altitude aerosols in the planet's atmosphere. Here we report a spectroscopic thermal phase curve of GJ 1214b obtained with JWST in the mid-infrared. The dayside and nightside spectra (average brightness temperatures of 553 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 9 and 437 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 19 K, respectively) each show {\textgreater}3\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ evidence of absorption features, with H\$\_2\$O as the most likely cause in both. The measured global thermal emission implies that GJ 1214b's Bond albedo is 0.51 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.06. Comparison between the spectroscopic phase curve data and three-dimensional models of GJ 1214b reveal a planet with a high metallicity atmosphere blanketed by a thick and highly reflective layer of clouds or haze.},

	abstract = {The TRAPPIST-1 system is remarkable for its seven planets that are similar in size, mass, density, and stellar heating to the rocky planets Venus, Earth, and Mars in our own Solar System (Gillon et al. 2017). All TRAPPIST-1 planets have been observed with the transmission spectroscopy technique using the Hubble or Spitzer Space Telescopes, but no atmospheric features have been detected or strongly constrained (Ducrot et al. 2018; de Wit et al. 2018; Zhang et al. 2018; Garcia et al. 2022). TRAPPIST-1 b is the closest planet to the system's M dwarf star, and it receives 4 times as much irradiation as Earth receives from the Sun. This relatively large amount of stellar heating suggests that its thermal emission may be measurable. Here we present photometric secondary eclipse observations of the Earth-sized TRAPPIST-1 b exoplanet using the F1500W filter of the MIRI instrument on JWST. We detect the secondary eclipse in each of five separate observations with 8.7-\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ confidence when all data are combined. These measurements are most consistent with the re-radiation of the TRAPPIST-1 star's incident flux from only the dayside hemisphere of the planet. The most straightforward interpretation is that there is little or no planetary atmosphere redistributing radiation from the host star and also no detectable atmospheric absorption from carbon dioxide (CO\$\_2\$) or other species.},

	abstract = {We present new Spitzer observations of the phase variation of the hot Jupiter HD 189733b in the MIPS 24 μm bandpass, spanning the same part of the planet's orbit as our previous observations in the IRAC 8 μm bandpass (Knutson et al. 2007). We find that the minimum hemisphere-averaged flux from the planet in this bandpass is 76\% ± 3\% of the maximum flux; this corresponds to minimum and maximum hemisphere-averaged brightness temperatures of 984 ± 48 K and 1220 ± 47 K, respectively. The planet reaches its maximum flux at an orbital phase of 0.396 ± 0.022, corresponding to a hot region shifted 20°–30° east of the substellar point. Because tidally locked hot Jupiters would have enormous day–night temperature differences in the absence of winds, the small amplitude of the observed phase variation indicates that the planet's atmosphere efficiently transports thermal energy from the day side to the night side at the 24 μm photosphere, leading to modest day–night temperature differences. The similarities between the 8 and 24 μm phase curves for HD 189733b lead us to conclude that the circulation on this planet behaves in a fundamentally similar fashion across the range of pressures sensed by these two wavelengths. One-dimensional radiative transfer models indicate that the 8 μm band should probe pressures 2–3 times greater than at 24 μm, although the uncertain methane abundance complicates the interpretation. If these two bandpasses do probe different pressures, it would indicate that the temperature varies only weakly between the two sensed depths, and hence that the atmosphere is not convective at these altitudes. We also present an analysis of the possible contribution of star spots to the time series at both 8 and 24 μm based on near-simultaneous ground-based observations and additional Spitzer observations. Accounting for the effects of these spots results in a slightly warmer night-side temperature for the planet in both bandpasses, but does not otherwise affect our conclusions.},

	abstract = {Transmission spectra are differential measurements that utilize stellar illumination to probe transiting exoplanet atmospheres. Any spectral difference between the illuminating light source and the disk-integrated stellar spectrum due to starspots and faculae will be imprinted in the observed transmission spectrum. However, few constraints exist for the extent of photospheric heterogeneities in M dwarfs. Here we model spot and faculae covering fractions consistent with observed photometric variabilities for M dwarfs and the associated 0.3–5.5 μm stellar contamination spectra. We find that large ranges of spot and faculae covering fractions are consistent with observations and corrections assuming a linear relation between variability amplitude, and covering fractions generally underestimate the stellar contamination. Using realistic estimates for spot and faculae covering fractions, we find that stellar contamination can be more than 10× larger than the transit depth changes expected for atmospheric features in rocky exoplanets. We also find that stellar spectral contamination can lead to systematic errors in radius and therefore the derived density of small planets. In the case of the TRAPPIST-1 system, we show that TRAPPIST-1's rotational variability is consistent with spot covering fractions and faculae covering fractions . The associated stellar contamination signals alter the transit depths of the TRAPPIST-1 planets at wavelengths of interest for planetary atmospheric species by roughly 1–15× the strength of planetary features, significantly complicating JWST follow-up observations of this system. Similarly, we find that stellar contamination can lead to underestimates of the bulk densities of the TRAPPIST-1 planets of , thus leading to overestimates of their volatile contents.},

All lie in the same region of the H-R diagram as our previously confirmed γ Dor stars. Of the nine systems, one is a single-lined spectroscopic binary (SB1), two are double-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB2), and the remaining six are single stars. We present orbits for the three binary systems: HD 34415, HD 144839, and HD 182735. Their periods are 6400 days or 17.5 yr (adopted), 995 ± 7 days, and 1052.4 ± 0.2 days, respectively. We compare our photometric periods with those we derive for six of the nine stars observed with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite to strengthen the confirmation of these new γ Dor variables. Finally, because the distribution of γ Dor stars in the H-R diagram overlaps with the red edge of the δ Scuti (δ Sct) instability strip, we use our ground-based photometric results for the 73 γ Dor stars confirmed with our Automatic Photoelectric Telescopes over the past two decades to look at the incidence of hybrid δ Sct/γ Dor stars; these are highly valuable targets for asteroseismology.},

Often in one-dimensional radiative–convective models and in three-dimensional general circulation models it is assumed that Tint is similar to that of Jupiter itself, around 100 K, which yields an RCB around 1 kbar for hot Jupiters. In this work, we show that the inflated radii, and hence high specific entropy interiors (8–11 kb/baryon), of hot Jupiters suggest much higher Tint. Assuming the effect is primarily due to current heating (rather than delayed cooling), we derive an equilibrium relation between Teq and Tint, showing that the latter can take values as high as 700 K. In response, the RCB moves upward in the atmosphere. Using one-dimensional radiative–convective atmosphere models, we find RCBs of only a few bars, rather than the kilobar typically supposed. This much shallower RCB has important implications for the atmospheric structure, vertical and horizontal circulation, interpretation of atmospheric spectra, and the effect of deep cold traps on cloud formation.},

	abstract = {Out of the known transiting extrasolar planets, the majority are gas giants orbiting their host star at close proximity. Both theoretical and observational studies support the hypothesis that such bodies emit signiﬁcant amounts of ﬂux relative to the host star, increasing towards infrared wavelengths. For the dayside of the exoplanet, this phenomenon typically permits detectable secondary eclipses at such wavelengths, which may be used to infer atmospheric composition. In this paper, we explore the effects of emission from the nightside of the exoplanet on the primary transit light curve, which is essentially a self-blend. Allowing for nightside emission, an exoplanet’s transit depth is no longer exclusively a function of the ratio-of-radii. The nightside of an exoplanet is emitting ﬂux, and the contrast to the star’s emission is of the order of ∼10−3 for hot Jupiters. Consequently, we show that the transit depth in the mid-infrared will be attenuated due to ﬂux contribution from the nightside emission by ∼10−4. We show how this effect can be compensated for in the case where exoplanet phase curves have been measured, in particular for HD 189733b. For other systems, it may be possible to make a ﬁrstorder correction by using temperature estimates of the planet. Unless the effect is accounted for, transmission spectra will also be polluted by nightside emission, and we estimate that a Spitzer broad-band spectrum on a bright target is altered at the 1σ level. Using archived Spitzer measurements, we show that the effect respectively increases the 8.0-μm and 24.0-μm transit depths by 1σ and 0.5σ per transit for HD 189733b. Consequently, we estimate that this would be ∼5–10σ effect for near future James Webb Space Telescope observations.},

	abstract = {The Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) uses three Si:As impurity band conduction (IBC) detector arrays. The output voltage level of each MIRI detector pixel is digitally recorded by sampling-up-the-ramp. For uniform or low-contrast illumination, the pixel ramps become non-linear in a predictable way, but in areas of high contrast, the non-linearity curve becomes much more complex. We provide observational evidence of the Brighter-Fatter Effect (BFE) in MIRI conventional and high-contrast coronographic imaging, low-resolution spectroscopy, and medium-resolution spectroscopy data and investigate the physical mechanism that gives rise to the effect on the detector pixel raw voltage integration ramps. We use public data from the JWST/MIRI commissioning and Cycle 1 phase. We also develop a numerical electrostatic model of the MIRI detectors using a modified version of the public Poisson\_CCD code. The physical mechanism behind the MIRI BFE is fundamentally different to that of CCDs and Hawaii-2RG (H2RG) detectors. This is due to the largest majority of the MIRI photo-excited electric charges not being stored at the pixels but at the input to the MIRI detector unit cell buffer amplifier capacitance. The resulting detector voltage debiasing alters the electrostatic potential inside the infrared-active layer and causes new photo-excited electrons, generated at a bright pixel, to be guided to the neighboring fainter pixels. Observationally, the debiasing-induced BFE makes the JWST MIRI data yield 10-25 \% larger and 0.5-8 \% brighter point sources and spectral line profiles as a function of the output level covered by the detector pixels. We find that the profile of the shrinking detector depletion region has implications for developing a pixel ramp non-linearity model for point sources observed with MIRI.},

	abstract = {We present the dayside thermal emission spectrum of WASP-77Ab from 2.8 -- 5.2 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m as observed with the NIRSpec instrument on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). WASP-77Ab was previously found to have a sub-solar metallicity and a solar carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio from H\$\_2\$O and CO absorption lines detected using high-resolution spectroscopy. By performing atmospheric retrievals on the JWST spectrum assuming chemical equilibrium, we find a sub-solar metallicity [M/H]=\$-0.91{\textasciicircum}\{+0.24\}\_\{-0.16\}\$ and C/O ratio \$0.36{\textasciicircum}\{+0.10\}\_\{-0.09\}\$. We identify H\$\_2\$O and CO and constrain their abundances, and we find no CO\$\_2\$ in the spectrum. The JWST and high-resolution spectroscopy results agree within \${\textbackslash}sim1{\textbackslash}sigma\$ for the metallicity and within 1.8\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ for the C/O ratio. However, our results fit less well in the picture painted by the shorter wavelength spectrum measured by HST WFC3. Comparing the JWST thermal emission spectra of WASP-77Ab and HD 149026b shows that both hot Jupiters have nearly identical brightness temperatures in the near-infrared, but distinctly different atmospheric compositions. Our results reaffirm high-resolution spectroscopy as a powerful and reliable method to measure molecular abundances. Our results also highlight the incredible diversity of hot Jupiter atmospheric compositions.},

	abstract = {The future is now - after its long-awaited launch in December 2021, JWST began science operations in July 2022 and is already revolutionizing exoplanet astronomy. The Early Release Observations (ERO) program was designed to provide the first images and spectra from JWST, covering a multitude of science cases and using multiple modes of each on-board instrument. Here, we present transmission spectroscopy observations of the hot-Saturn WASP-96b with the Single Object Slitless Spectroscopy (SOSS) mode of the Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph, observed as part of the ERO program. As the SOSS mode presents some unique data reduction challenges, we provide an in-depth walk-through of the major steps necessary for the reduction of SOSS data: including background subtraction, correction of 1/f noise, and treatment of the trace order overlap. We furthermore offer potential routes to correct for field star contamination, which can occur due to the SOSS mode's slitless nature. By comparing our extracted transmission spectrum with grids of atmosphere models, we find an atmosphere metallicity between 1x and 5x solar, and a solar carbon-to-oxygen ratio. Moreover, our models indicate that no grey cloud deck is required to fit WASP-96b's transmission spectrum, but find evidence for a slope shortward of 0.9\${\textbackslash}mu\$m, which could either be caused by enhanced Rayleigh scattering or the red wing of a pressure-broadened Na feature. Our work demonstrates the unique capabilities of the SOSS mode for exoplanet transmission spectroscopy and presents a step-by-step reduction guide for this new and exciting instrument.},

The data were obtained as part of the MIRI commissioning activities, to characterize the performance of the Low Resolution Spectroscopy (LRS) mode for these challenging observations. To assess the MIRI LRS performance, we performed two independent analyses of the data. We find that with a single transit observation we reached a spectro-photometric precision of ∼50 ppm in the 7–8 μm range at R = 50, consistent with ∼25 ppm systematic noise. The derived band averaged transit depth is 524 ± 15 ppm and 547 ± 13 ppm for the two applied analysis methods, respectively, recovering the known transit depth to within 1σ. The measured noise in the planet’s transmission spectrum is approximately 15\%–20\% higher than random noise simulations over wavelengths 6.8 ≲ λ ≲ 11 μm. We observed an larger excess noise at the shortest wavelengths of up to a factor of two, for which possible causes are discussed. This performance was achieved with limited in-flight calibration data, demonstrating the future potential of MIRI for the characterization of exoplanet atmospheres.},

	abstract = {GJ 436b is a prime target for understanding warm Neptune exoplanet atmospheres and a target for multiple James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Guaranteed Time Observation programs. Here, we report the first space-based optical transmission spectrum of the planet using two Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) transit observations from 0.53 to 1.03 μm. We find no evidence for alkali absorption features, nor evidence of a scattering slope longward of 0.53 μm. The spectrum is indicative of moderate to high metallicity (∼100–1000× solar), while moderate-metallicity scenarios (∼100× solar) require aerosol opacity. The optical spectrum also rules out some highly scattering haze models. We find an increase in transit depth around 0.8 μm in the transmission spectra of three different sub-Jovian exoplanets (GJ 436b, HAT-P-26b, and GJ 1214b). While most of the data come from STIS, data from three other instruments may indicate this is not an instrumental effect. Only the transit spectrum of GJ 1214b is well fit by a model with stellar plages on the photosphere of the host star. Our photometric monitoring of the host star reveals a stellar rotation rate of 44.1 days and an activity cycle of 7.4 years. Intriguingly, GJ 436 does not become redder as it gets dimmer, which is expected if star spots were dominating the variability. These insights into the nature of the GJ 436 system help refine our expectations for future observations in the era of JWST, whose higher precision and broader wavelength coverage will shed light on the composition and structure of GJ 436b’s atmosphere.},

Continuous broadband photometric monitoring of β Pic requires ground-based observatories at multiple longitudes to provide redundancy and to provide triggers for rapid spectroscopic follow-up. These include the dedicated β Pic monitoring bRing observatories in Sutherland and Siding Springs, the ASTEP400 telescope at Concordia, and the space observatories BRITE and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We search the combined light curves for evidence of short-period transient events caused by rings as well as for longer-term photometric variability due to diffuse circumplanetary material.
Results. We ﬁnd no photometric event that matches with the event seen in November 1981, and there is no systematic photometric dimming of the star as a function of the Hill sphere radius.
Conclusions. We conclude that the 1981 event was not caused by the transit of a CPD around β Pic b. The upper limit on the long-term variability of β Pic places an upper limit of 1.8 × 1022 g of dust within the Hill sphere (comparable to the ∼100 km radius asteroid 16 Psyche). Circumplanetary material is either condensed into a disk that does not transit β Pic, condensed into a disk with moons that has an obliquity that does not intersect with the path of β Pic behind the Hill sphere, or is below our detection threshold. This is the ﬁrst time that a dedicated international campaign has mapped the Hill sphere transit of an extrasolar gas giant planet at 10 au.},

	abstract = {Unlike previously explored relationships between the properties of hot Jovian atmospheres, the geometric albedo and the incident stellar flux do not exhibit a clear correlation, as revealed by our re-analysis of Q0–Q14 Kepler data. If the albedo is primarily associated with the presence of clouds in these irradiated atmospheres, a holistic modeling approach needs to relate the following properties: the strength of stellar irradiation (and hence the strength and depth of atmospheric circulation), the geometric albedo (which controls both the fraction of starlight absorbed and the pressure level at which it is predominantly absorbed), and the properties of the embedded cloud particles (which determine the albedo). The anticipated diversity in cloud properties renders any correlation between the geometric albedo and the stellar flux weak and characterized by considerable scatter. In the limit of vertically uniform populations of scatterers and absorbers, we use an analytical model and scaling relations to relate the temperature–pressure profile of an irradiated atmosphere and the photon deposition layer and to estimate whether a cloud particle will be lofted by atmospheric circulation. We derive an analytical formula for computing the albedo spectrum in terms of the cloud properties, which we compare to the measured albedo spectrum of HD 189733b by Evans et al. Furthermore, we show that whether an optical phase curve is flat or sinusoidal depends on whether the particles are small or large as defined by the Knudsen number. This may be an explanation for why Kepler-7b exhibits evidence for the longitudinal variation in abundance of condensates, while Kepler-12b shows no evidence for the presence of condensates despite the incident stellar flux being similar for both exoplanets. We include an “observer's cookbook” for deciphering various scenarios associated with the optical phase curve, the peak offset of the infrared phase curve, and the geometric albedo.},

We do not see evidence for additional species in the MAROON-X data, including notably predicted thermal inversion agents TiO and VO, their atomic constituents Ti i and V i, and previously claimed species Fe ii and Cr i. We also perform a joint retrieval with existing Hubble Space Telescope/WFC3 spectroscopy and Spitzer/IRAC photometry. This allows us to place bounded constraints on the abundances of Fe i, H2O, and CO, and to place a stringent upper limit on the TiO abundance. The results are consistent with KELT-20b having a solar to slightly supersolar composition atmosphere in terms of the bulk metal enrichment, and the carbon-to-oxygen and iron-to-oxygen ratios. However, the TiO volume mixing ratio upper limit (10−7.6 at 99\% confidence) is inconsistent with this picture, which, along with the nondetection of Ti i, points to sequestration of Ti species, possibly due to nightside condensation. The lack of TiO but the presence of a large H2O emission feature in the WFC3 data is challenging to reconcile within the context of 1D self-consistent, radiative-convective models.},

We validate our methodology by confirming a previous detection of Fe i in emission at 16.9σ. Our search for the inversion agents TiO, VO, FeH, and CaH results in non-detections. Using injection-recovery testing we set 4σ upper limits upon the volume mixing ratios for these constituents as low as ∼1 × 10−9 for TiO. For TiO, VO, and CaH, our limits are much lower than expectations from an equilibrium chemical model, while we cannot set constraining limits on FeH with our data.

	abstract = {Methods. We developed a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code and applied it to post-process output of our 3D radiative-hydrodynamic, cloud formation simulation of HD 189733b. We employed three variance reduction techniques, i.e. next event estimation, survival biasing, and composite emission biasing, to improve signal to noise of the output. For cloud particle scattering events, we constructed a log-normal area distribution from the 3D cloud formation radiative-hydrodynamic results, which is stochastically sampled in order to model the Rayleigh and Mie scattering behaviour of a mixture of grain sizes.
Results. Stellar photon packets incident on the eastern dayside hemisphere show predominantly Rayleigh, single-scattering behaviour, while multiple scattering occurs on the western hemisphere. Combined scattered and thermal emitted light predictions are consistent with published HST and Spitzer secondary transit observations. Our model predictions are also consistent with geometric albedo constraints from optical wavelength ground-based polarimetry and HST B band measurements. We predict an apparent geometric albedo for HD 189733b of 0.205 and 0.229, in the TESS and CHEOPS photometric bands respectively.
Conclusions. Modelling the 3D geometric scattering eﬀects of clouds on observables of exoplanet atmospheres provides an important contribution to the attempt to determine the cloud properties of these objects. Comparisons between TESS and CHEOPS photometry may provide qualitative information on the cloud properties of nearby hot Jupiter exoplanets.},

	abstract = {Methods. We analysed 13 observations of the occultation of HD 189733b performed by CHEOPS utilising the Python package PyCHEOPS. The resulting occultation depth is then used to infer the geometric albedo accounting for the contribution of thermal emission from the planet. We also aid the analysis by reﬁning the transit parameters combining observations made by the TESS and CHEOPS space telescopes.
Results. We report the detection of an 24.7 ± 4.5 ppm occultation in the CHEOPS observations. This occultation depth corresponds to a geometric albedo of 0.076 ± 0.016. Our measurement is consistent with models assuming the atmosphere of the planet to be cloud-free at the scattering level and absorption in the CHEOPS band to be dominated by the resonant Na doublet. Taking into account previous optical-light occultation observations obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope, both measurements combined are consistent with a super-stellar Na elemental abundance in the dayside atmosphere of HD 189733b. We further constrain the planetary Bond albedo to between 0.013 and 0.42 at 3σ conﬁdence.
Conclusions. We ﬁnd that the reﬂective properties of the HD 189733b dayside atmosphere are consistent with a cloud-free atmosphere having a super-stellar metal content. When compared to an analogous CHEOPS measurement for HD 209458b, our data hint at a slightly lower geometric albedo for HD 189733b (0.076 ± 0.016) than for HD 209458b (0.096 ± 0.016), or a higher atmospheric Na content in the same modelling framework. While our constraint on the Bond albedo is consistent with previously published values, we note that the higher-end values of ∼0.4, as derived previously from infrared phase curves, would also require peculiarly high reﬂectance in the infrared, which again would make it more difﬁcult to disentangle reﬂected and emitted light in the total observed ﬂux, and therefore to correctly account for reﬂected light in the interpretation of those phase curves. Lower reported values for the Bond albedos are less affected by this ambiguity.},

	abstract = {We present a visible-light full orbital phase curve of the transiting planet WASP-18b measured by the TESS mission. The phase curve includes the transit, secondary eclipse, and sinusoidal modulations across the orbital phase shaped by the planet’s atmospheric characteristics and the star–planet gravitational interaction. We measure the beaming (Doppler boosting) and tidal ellipsoidal distortion phase modulations and show that the amplitudes of both agree with theoretical expectations. We find that the light from the planet’s dayside hemisphere occulted during secondary eclipse, with a relative brightness of ppm, is dominated by thermal emission, leading to an upper limit on the geometric albedo in the TESS band of 0.048 (). We also detect the phase modulation due to the planet’s atmosphere longitudinal brightness distribution. We find that its maximum is well aligned with the substellar point to within 2.°9 (). We do not detect light from the planet’s nightside hemisphere, with an upper limit of 43 ppm (), which is 13\% of the dayside brightness. The low albedo, lack of atmospheric phase shift, and inefficient heat distribution from the day to night hemispheres that we deduce from our analysis are consistent with theoretical expectations and similar findings for other strongly irradiated gas giant planets. This work demonstrates the potential of TESS data for studying the full orbital phase curves of transiting systems. Finally, we complement our study by looking for transit timing variations (TTVs) in the TESS data combined with previously published transit times, although we do not find a statistically significant TTV signal.},

TOI-5205b has one of the highest mass ratios for M-dwarf planets, with a mass ratio of almost 0.3\%, as it orbits a host star that is just 0.392 ± 0.015 M ⊙. Its planetary radius is 1.03 ± 0.03 R J, while the mass is 1.08 ± 0.06 M J. Additionally, the large size of the planet orbiting a small star results in a transit depth of ∼7\%, making it one of the deepest transits of a confirmed exoplanet orbiting a main-sequence star. The large transit depth makes TOI-5205b a compelling target to probe its atmospheric properties, as a means of tracing the potential formation pathways. While there have been radial-velocity-only discoveries of giant planets around mid-M dwarfs, this is the first transiting Jupiter with a mass measurement discovered around such a low-mass host star. The high mass of TOI-5205b stretches conventional theories of planet formation and disk scaling relations that cannot easily recreate the conditions required to form such planets.},

We present here the photometric reflected light observations of WASP-43b using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFC3/UVIS instrument with the F350LP filter (346–822 nm) encompassing the entire optical band. This is the first reflected light photometric eclipse using UVIS in scanning mode; as such, we further detail our scanning extraction and analysis pipeline Arctor. Our HST WFC3/UVIS eclipse light curve for WASP-43b derived a 3σ upper limit of 67 ppm on the eclipse depth, which implies that WASP-43b has a very dark dayside atmosphere. With our atmospheric modeling campaign, we compared our reflected light constraints with predictions from global circulation and cloud models benchmarked with HST and Spitzer observations of WASP-43b. We infer that we do not detect clouds on the dayside within the pressure levels probed by HST WFC3/UVIS with the F350LP filter (P {\textgreater} 1 bar). This is consistent with the general circulation model predictions based on previous WASP-43b observations. Dayside emission spectroscopy results from WASP-43b with HST and Spitzer observations are likely to not be significantly affected by contributions from cloud particles.},

	abstract = {Atmospheric metal enrichment (i.e., elements heavier than helium, also called “metallicity”) is a key diagnostic of the formation of giant planets1-3. The giant planets of the solar system exhibit an inverse relationship between mass and both their bulk metallicities and atmospheric metallicities. Extrasolar giant planets also display an inverse relationship between mass and bulk metallicity4. However, there is significant scatter in the relationship and it is not known how atmospheric metallicity correlates with either planet mass or bulk metallicity. Here we show that the Saturn-mass exoplanet HD 149026b5-9 has an atmospheric metallicity 59 - 276 times solar (at 1σ), which is greater than Saturn’s atmospheric metallicity of {\textasciitilde}7.5 times solar10 at {\textgreater}4σ confidence. This result is based on modeling CO2 and H2O absorption features in the thermal emission spectrum of the planet measured by JWST. HD 149026b is the most metal-rich giant planet known, with an estimated bulk heavy element abundance of 66±2\% by mass11,12. We find that the atmospheric metallicities of both HD 149026b and the solar system giant planets are more correlated with bulk metallicity than planet mass.},

Despite considerable telluric contamination in this wavelength regime, we detect the signal within our uncertainties at the expected combination of systemic velocity (\$V\_\{{\textbackslash}rm sys\}=-3{\textasciicircum}\{+5\}\_\{-6\}\$ km s−1) and planet orbital velocity (\$K\_\{{\textbackslash}rm p\}=154{\textasciicircum}\{+14\}\_\{-10\}\$ km s−1), and determine a H2O line contrast ratio of (1.3 ± 0.2) × 10−3 with respect to the stellar continuum. We find no evidence of significant absorption or emission from other carbon-bearing molecules, such as methane, although we do note a marginal increase in the significance of our detection to 5.1σ with the inclusion of carbon dioxide in our template spectrum. This result demonstrates that ground-based, high-resolution spectroscopy is suited to finding not just simple molecules like CO, but also to more complex molecules like H2O even in highly telluric contaminated regions of the Earth's transmission spectrum. It is a powerful tool that can be used for conducting an immediate census of the carbon- and oxygen-bearing molecules in the atmospheres of giant planets, and will potentially allow the formation and migration history of these planets to be constrained by the measurement of their atmospheric C/O ratios.},

This large signal will allow a detailed characterization of this planet in the infrared. Our photometry has sufﬁcient signal-to-noise ratio (\$400 per point) to motivate a search for structure in the ingress/egress portions of the eclipse curve, caused by putative thermal structure on the disk of the planet. We show that by binning our 6 s sampling down to \$6 minute resolution, we detect the modulation in the intensity derivative during ingress/egress due to the overall shape of the planet, but our sensitivity is not yet sufﬁcient to distinguish between realistic models of the temperature distribution across the planet’s disk.

The HST data also reveal clear evidence of the planet occulting spots on the surface of the star.

This feature is compatible in amplitude and phase with the variability observed simultaneously from the ground. No evidence for satellites or rings around HD 189733b is seen in the HST lightcurve. This allows us to exlude with a high probability the presence of Earth-sized moons and Saturn-type debris rings around this planet.

	abstract = {Transiting exoplanets provide detailed access to their atmospheres, as the planet's signal can be effectively separated from that of its host star. For transiting exoplanets three fundamental atmospheric measurements are possible: transmission spectra - where atmospheric absorption features are detected across an exoplanets limb during transit, emission spectra - where the day-side average emission of the planet is detected during secondary eclipse events, and phase curves - where the spectral emission of the planet is mapped globally following the planet around its orbit. All of these techniques have been well proven to provide detailed characterisation information about planets ranging from super-Earth to Jupiter size. In this chapter, I present the overall background, history and methodology of these measurements. A few of the major science related questions are also discussed, which range from broad questions about planet formation and migration, to detailed atmospheric physics questions about how a planet's atmosphere responds under extreme conditions. I also discuss the analysis methods and light-curve fitting techniques that have been developed to help reach the extreme spectrophotometric accuracies needed, and how to derive reliable error estimates despite limiting systematic errors. As a transmission spectra derived from primary transit is a unique measurement outside of our solar system, I discuss its physical interpretation and the underlying degeneracies associated with the measurement.},

	abstract = {We re-visit the principles of transmission spectroscopy for transiting extrasolar planets, focusing on the overlap between the planetary spectrum and the illuminating stellar spectrum. Virtually all current models of exoplanetary transmission spectra utilize an approximation that is inaccurate when the spectrum of the illuminating star has a complex line structure, such as molecular bands in M-dwarf spectra. In those cases, it is desirable to model the observations using a coupled stellar–planetary radiative transfer model calculated at high spectral resolving power, followed by convolution to the observed resolution. Not consistently accounting for overlap of stellar M-dwarf and planetary lines at high spectral resolution can bias the modeled amplitude of the exoplanetary transmission spectrum, producing modeled absorption that is too strong. We illustrate this bias using the exoplanet TRAPPIST1b, as observed using Hubble Space Telescope/WFC3. The bias in this case is about 250 ppm, 12\% of the modeled transit absorption. Transit spectroscopy using JWST will have access to longer wavelengths where the water bands are intrinsically stronger, and the observed signal-to-noise ratios will be higher than currently possible. We therefore expect that this resolution-linked bias will be especially important for future JWST observations of TESSdiscovered super-Earths and mini-Neptunes transiting M-dwarfs.},

	abstract = {Stellar limb darkening affects a wide range of astronomical measurements and is frequently modelled with a parametric model using polynomials in the cosine of the angle between the line of sight and the emergent intensity. Two-parameter laws are particularly popular for cases where one wishes to fit freely for the limb darkening coefficients (i.e. an uninformative prior) due to the compact prior volume and the fact that more complex models rarely obtain unique solutions with present data. In such cases, we show that the two limb darkening coefficients are constrained by three physical boundary conditions, describing a triangular region in the two-dimensional parameter space. We show that uniformly distributed samples may be drawn from this region with optimal efficiency by a technique developed by computer graphical programming: triangular sampling. Alternatively, one can make draws using a uniform, bivariate Dirichlet distribution. We provide simple expressions for these parametrizations for both techniques applied to the case of quadratic, square-root and logarithmic limb darkening laws. For example, in the case of the popular quadratic law, we advocate fitting for q\_1 = (u\_1+u\_2){\textasciicircum}2 and q\_2 = 0.5u\_1(u\_1+u\_2){\textasciicircum}\{-1\} with uniform priors in the interval [0,1] to implement triangular sampling easily. Employing these parametrizations allows one to derive model parameters which fully account for our ignorance about the intensity profile, yet never explore unphysical solutions, yielding robust and realistic uncertainty estimates. Furthermore, in the case of triangular sampling with the quadratic law, our parametrization leads to significantly reduced mutual correlations and provides an alternative geometric explanation as to why naively fitting the quadratic limb darkening coefficients precipitates strong correlations in the first place.},

	abstract = {Methods. Using the Eddington approximation, we derive an analytical model to account for lines and/or bands in the infrared. Four parameters (instead of two for the semi-grey models) are used: a visible opacity (κv), two infrared opacities, (κ1 and κ2), and β (the fraction of the energy in the beam with opacities κ1). We consider that the atmosphere receives an incident irradiation in the visible with an eﬀective temperature Tirr and at an angle µ∗, and that it is heated from below with an eﬀective temperature Tint.
Results. Our non-grey, irradiated line model is found to provide a range of temperatures that is consistent with that obtained by numerical calculations. We ﬁnd that if the stellar ﬂux is absorbed at optical depth larger than τlim = (κR/κ1κ2)(κRκP/3)1/2, it is mainly transported by the channel of lowest opacity whereas if it is absorbed at τ {\textgreater}∼ τlim it is mainly transported by the channel of highest opacity, independently of the spectral width of those channels. For low values of β (expected when lines are dominant), we ﬁnd that the non-grey eﬀects signiﬁcantly cool the upper atmosphere. However, for β {\textgreater}∼ 1/2 (appropriate in the presence of bands with a wavelength-dependence smaller than or comparable to the width of the Planck function), we ﬁnd that the temperature structure is aﬀected down to infrared optical depths unity and deeper as a result of the so-called blanketing eﬀect.
Conclusions. The expressions that we derive can be used to provide a proper functional form for algorithms that invert the atmospheric properties from spectral information. Because a full atmospheric structure can be calculated directly, these expressions should be useful for simulations of the dynamics of these atmospheres and of the thermal evolution of the planets. Finally, they should be used to test full radiative transfer models and to improve their convergence.},

We have reviewed the data for molecular equilibrium constants, kp(T ), from several sources and discussed which functional ﬁts are most suitable for low temperatures. We benchmarked our results against another chemical equilibrium code. We collected Gibbs free energies, ∆Gf−◦, for about 200 solid and liquid species from the NIST-JANAF database and the geophysical database SUPCRTBL. We discussed the condensation sequence of the elements with solar abundances in phase equilibrium down to 100 K. Once the major magnesium silicates Mg2SiO4[s] and MgSiO3[s] have formed, the dust to gas mass ratio jumps to a value of about 0.0045 which is signiﬁcantly lower than the often assumed value of 0.01. Silicate condensation is found to increase the carbon to oxygen ratio (C/O) in the gas from its solar value of ∼0.55 up to ∼0.71, and, by the additional intake of water and hydroxyl into the solid matrix, the formation of phyllosilicates at temperatures below ∼400 K increases the gaseous C/O further to about 0.83. Metallic tungsten (W) is the ﬁrst condensate found to become thermodynamically stable around 1600–2200 K (depending on pressure), several hundreds of Kelvin before subsequent materials such as zirconium dioxide (ZrO2) or corundum (Al2O3) can condense. We brieﬂy discuss whether tungsten, despite its low abundance of ∼2 × 10−7 times the silicon abundance, could provide the ﬁrst seed particles for astrophysical dust formation.},

	abstract = {James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) transmission and emission spectra will provide invaluable glimpses of transiting exoplanet atmospheres, including possible biosignatures. This promising science from JWST, however, will require exquisite precision and understanding of systematic errors that can impact the time series of planets crossing in front of and behind their host stars. Here, we provide estimates of the random noise sources affecting JWST Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) time-series data on the integration-to-integration level. We ﬁnd that 1/f noise can limit the precision of grism time series for two groups (230–1000 ppm depending on the extraction method and extraction parameters), but will average down like the square root of N frames/reads. The current NIRCam grism time-series mode is especially affected by 1/f noise because its GRISMR dispersion direction is parallel to the detector fast-read direction, but could be alleviated in the GRISMC direction. Care should be taken to include as many frames as possible per visit to reduce this 1/f noise source: thus, we recommend the smallest detector subarray sizes one can tolerate, four output channels, and readout modes that minimize the number of skipped frames (RAPID or BRIGHT2). We also describe a covariance-weighting scheme that can signiﬁcantly lower the contributions from 1/f noise as compared to sum extraction. We evaluate the noise introduced by preampliﬁer offsets, random telegraph noise, and high dark current resistor capacitor (RC) pixels and ﬁnd that these are correctable below 10 ppm once background subtraction and pixel masking are performed. We explore systematic error sources in a companion paper.},

Here, we discuss the systematic error sources that are expected to be present in grism time series observations with the NIRCam instrument. We find that pointing jitter and high gain antenna moves on top of the detectors' subpixel crosshatch patterns will produce relatively small variations (less than 6 parts per million, ppm). The time-dependent aperture losses due to thermal instabilities in the optics can also be kept to below 2 ppm. To achieve these low noise sources, it is important to employ a sufficiently large (more than 1.1 arcseconds) extraction aperture. Persistence due to charge trapping will have a minor (less than 3 ppm) effect on time series 20 minutes into an exposure and is expected to play a much smaller role than it does for the HST WFC3 detectors. We expect temperature fluctuations to be less than 3 ppm. In total, our estimated noise floor from known systematic error sources is only 9 ppm per visit. We do however urge caution as unknown systematic error sources could be present in flight and will only be measurable on astrophysical sources like quiescent stars. We find that reciprocity failure may introduce a perennial instrument offset at the 40 ppm level, so corrections may be needed when stitching together a multi-instrument multi-observatory spectrum over wide wavelength ranges.},

	abstract = {We study the emergent spectral fluxes of transiting hot Jupiters, using secondary eclipses from Spitzer. To achieve a large and uniform sample, we have re-analyzed all secondary eclipses for all hot Jupiters observed by Spitzer at 3.6- and/or 4.5 microns. Our sample comprises 457 eclipses of 122 planets, including eclipses of 13 planets not previously published. We use these eclipse depths to calculate the spectral fluxes emergent from the exoplanetary atmospheres, and thereby infer temperature and spectral properties of hot Jupiters. We find that an abrupt rise in brightness temperature, similar to a phase change, occurs on the day side atmospheres of the population at an equilibrium temperature between 1714K and 1818K (99-percent confidence limits). The amplitude of the rise is 291 +/-49 Kelvins, and two viable causes are the onset of magnetic drag that inhibits longitudinal heat redistribution, and/or the rapid dissipation of day side clouds. We also study hot Jupiter spectral properties with respect to metallicity and temperature inversions. Models exhibiting 4.5 micron emission from temperature inversions reproduce our fluxes statistically for the hottest planets, but the transition to emission is gradual, not abrupt. The Spitzer fluxes are sensitive to metallicity for planets cooler than approximately 1200 Kelvins, and most of the hot Jupiter population falls between model tracks having solar to 30X-solar metallicity.},

In this work, we develop a theory to explain the magnitude of these winds. We model hot Jupiters as planetary heat engines and show that hot Jupiters are always less efﬁcient than an ideal Carnot engine. Next, we demonstrate that our predicted wind speeds match those from three-dimensional numerical simulations over a broad range of parameters. Finally, we use our theory to evaluate how well different drag mechanisms can match the wind speeds observed with Doppler spectroscopy for HD 189733b and HD 209458b. We ﬁnd that magnetic drag is potentially too weak to match the observations for HD 189733b, but is compatible with the observations for HD 209458b. In contrast, shear instabilities and/or shocks are compatible with both observations. Furthermore, the two mechanisms predict different wind speed trends for hotter and colder planets than currently observed. As a result, we propose that a wider range of Doppler observations could reveal multiple drag mechanisms at play across different hot Jupiters.},

	abstract = {The increasing richness of exoplanet observations has motivated a variety of three-dimensional (3D) atmospheric circulation models of these planets. Under strongly irradiated conditions, models of tidally locked, short-period planets (both hot Jupiters and terrestrial planets) tend to exhibit a circulation dominated by a fast eastward, or “superrotating,” jet stream at the equator. When the radiative and advection timescales are comparable, this phenomenon can cause the hottest regions to be displaced eastward from the substellar point by tens of degrees longitude. Such an offset has been subsequently observed on HD 189733b, supporting the possibility of equatorial jets on short-period exoplanets. Despite its relevance, however, the dynamical mechanisms responsible for generating the equatorial superrotation in such models have not been identiﬁed. Here, we show that the equatorial jet results from the interaction of the mean ﬂow with standing Rossby waves induced by the day–night thermal forcing. The strong longitudinal variations in radiative heating—namely intense dayside heating and nightside cooling—trigger the formation of standing, planetary-scale equatorial Rossby and Kelvin waves. The Rossby waves develop phase tilts that pump eastward momentum from high latitudes to the equator, thereby inducing equatorial superrotation. We present an analytic theory demonstrating this mechanism and explore its properties in a hierarchy of one-layer (shallow-water) calculations and fully 3D models. The wave–mean-ﬂow interaction produces an equatorial jet whose latitudinal width is comparable to that of the Rossby waves, namely the equatorial Rossby deformation radius modiﬁed by radiative and frictional effects. For conditions typical of synchronously rotating hot Jupiters, this length is comparable to a planetary radius, explaining the broad scale of the equatorial jet obtained in most hot-Jupiter models. Our theory illuminates the dependence of the equatorial jet speed on forcing amplitude, strength of friction, and other parameters, as well as the conditions under which jets can form at all.},

Although these objects are all fluid, hydrogen worlds with stratified atmospheres overlying convective interiors, they exhibit an impressive diversity of atmospheric behavior. Hot Jupiters are strongly irradiated, and a wealth of observations constrain the day-night temperature differences, circulation, and cloudiness. The intense stellar irradiation, presumed tidal locking and modest rotation leads to a novel regime of strong day-night radiative forcing. Circulation models predict large day-night temperature differences, global-scale eddies, patchy clouds, and, in most cases, a fast eastward jet at the equator-equatorial superrotation. The warm Jupiters may exhibit a wide range of rotation rates, obliquities, and orbital eccentricities, which, along with the weaker irradiation, leads to circulation patterns and observable signatures predicted to differ substantially from hot Jupiters. Brown dwarfs are typically isolated, rapidly rotating worlds; they radiate enormous energy fluxes into space and convect vigorously in their interiors. Their atmospheres exhibit patchiness in clouds and temperature on regional to global scales-the result of modulation by large-scale atmospheric circulation. Despite the lack of irradiation, such circulations can be driven by interaction of the interior convection with the overlying atmosphere, as well as self-organization of patchiness due to cloud-dynamical-radiative feedbacks. Finally, irradiated brown dwarfs help to bridge the gap between these classes of objects, experiencing intense external irradiation as well as vigorous interior convection. A hierarchy of modeling approaches have yielded major new insights into the dynamics governing these phenomena.},

Atmospheric dynamics sets the background state of density, temperature, and velocity that determines or influences the spectral and temporal appearance of an exoplanetary atmosphere. Hot exoplanets are most amenable to these characterization techniques. In this review, we focus on highly irradiated, large exoplanets (the hot Jupiters), as astronomical data begin to confront theoretical questions. We summarize the basic atmospheric quantities inferred from the astronomical observations. We review the state of the art by addressing a series of current questions, and look toward the future by considering a separate set of exploratory questions. Attaining the next level of understanding requires a concerted effort of constructing multifaceted, multiwavelength datasets for benchmark objects. Understanding clouds presents a formidable obstacle, as they introduce degeneracies into the interpretation of spectra, yet their properties and existence are directly influenced by atmospheric dynamics. Confronting general circulation models with these multifaceted, multiwavelength datasets will help us understand these and other degeneracies.},

	abstract = {Hot Jupiters have been predicted to have a strong day/night temperature contrast and a hot spot shifted eastward of the substellar point. This was confirmed by numerous phase curve observations probing the longitudinal brightness variation of the atmosphere. Global circulation models, however, systematically underestimate the phase curve amplitude and overestimate the shift of its maximum. We use a global circulation model including non-grey radiative transfer and realistic gas and cloud opacities to systematically investigate how the atmospheric circulation of hot Jupiters varies with equilibrium temperature from 1000 to 2200K. We show that the heat transport is very efficient for cloudless planets cooler than 1600K and becomes less efficient at higher temperatures. When nightside clouds are present, the day-to-night heat transport becomes extremely inefficient, leading to a good match to the observed low nightside temperatures. The constancy of this low temperature is, however, due to the strong dependence of the radiative timescale with temperature. We further show that nightside clouds increase the phase curve amplitude and decreases the phase curve offset at the same time. This change is very sensitive to the cloud chemical composition and particle size, meaning that the diversity in observed phase curves can be explained by a diversity of nightside cloud properties. Finally, we show that phase curve parameters do not necessarily track the day/night contrast nor the shift of the hot spot on isobars, and propose solutions to to recover the true hot-spot shift and day/night contrast.},

Detailed theoretical studies are necessary to investigate the range of spectra that we can expect to see from these objects throughout their orbit, because of the extreme temperature and chemical longitudinal gradients that exist across their dayside and nightside regions. Using previously published 3D general circulation models of WASP-76b with different treatments of magnetic drag, we postprocess the 3D atmospheres to generate high-resolution emission spectra for two wavelength ranges, throughout the planet’s orbit. We ﬁnd that the high-resolution emission spectra vary strongly as a function of phase, at times showing emission features, absorption features, or both, which are a direct result of the 3D structure of the planet. At phases exhibiting both emission and absorption features, the Doppler shift differs in direction between the two spectral features, making them differentiable, instead of canceling each other out. Through the use of cross correlation, we ﬁnd different patterns in net Doppler shift for models with different treatments of drag: the nightside spectra show opposite signs in their Doppler shift, while the dayside phases display a reversal in the trend of net shift with phase. Finally, we caution researchers against using a single spectral template throughout the planet’s orbit; this can bias the corresponding net Doppler shift returned, as it can pick up on a bright region on the edge of the planet disk that is highly redshifted or blueshifted.},

On objects where the atmospheric electrical conductivity is substantial, the global circulation couples to the background magnetic field, inducing supplementary fields and altering the nature of the flow. To date, a number of authors have considered the influence of a spin-pole aligned dipole magnetic field on the dynamical state of a weakly-ionized atmosphere and found that magnetic breaking may lead to significantly slower winds than predicted within a purely hydrodynamical framework. Here, we consider the effect of a tilted dipole magnetic field on the circulation and demonstrate that in addition to regulating wind velocities, an oblique field generates stationary non-axisymmetric structures that adhere to the geometry of the magnetic pole. Using a kinematic perturbative approach, we derive a closed-form solution for the perturbed circulation and show that the fractional distortion of zonal jets scales as the product of the field obliquity and the Elsasser number. The results obtained herein suggest that on planets with oblique magnetic fields, advective shifts of dayside hotspots may have substantial latitudinal components. This prediction may be tested observationally using the eclipse mapping technique.},

	abstract = {Mapping distant worlds is the next frontier for exoplanet infrared photometry studies. Ultimately, constraining spatial and temporal properties of an exoplanet atmosphere will provide further insight into its physics. For tidally-locked hot Jupiters that transit and are eclipsed by their host star, the first steps are now possible. Our aim is to constrain an exoplanet's shape, brightness distribution (BD) and system parameters from its light curve. Notably, we rely on the eclipse scanning. We use archived Spitzer 8-\{{\textbackslash}mu\}m data of HD189733 (6 transits, 8 secondary eclipses, and a phase curve) in a global MCMC procedure for mitigating systematics. We also include HD189733's out-of-transit radial velocity measurements. We find a 6-\{{\textbackslash}sigma\} deviation from the expected occultation of a uniformly-bright disk. This deviation emerges mainly from HD189733b's thermal pattern, not from its shape. We indicate that the correlation of the orbital eccentricity, e, and BD (uniform time offset) does also depend on the stellar density, {\textbackslash}rho*, and the impact parameter, b (e-b-{\textbackslash}rho*-BD correlation). For HD189733b, we find that relaxing the e-constraint and using more complex BDs lead to lower stellar/planetary densities and a more localized and latitudinally-shifted hot spot. We obtain an improved constraint on the upper limit of HD189733b's orbital eccentricity, e{\textless}0.011 (95\%), when including the RV measurements. Our study provides new insights into the analysis of exoplanet light curves and a proper framework for future eclipse-scanning observations. Observations of the same exoplanet at different wavelengths will improve the constraints on its system parameters while ultimately yielding a large-scale time-dependent 3D map of its atmosphere. Finally, we discuss the perspective of extending our method to observations in the visible, in particular to better understand exoplanet albedos.},

	abstract = {Physical conditions in the atmospheres of tidally locked, slowly rotating hot Jupiters correspond to dynamical circulation regimes with Rhines scales and Rossby deformation radii comparable to the planetary radii. Consequently, the large spatial scales of moving atmospheric structures could generate signiﬁcant photospheric variability. Here we estimate the level of thermal infrared variability expected in successive secondary eclipse depths, according to hot Jupiter turbulent “shallow-layer” models. The variability, at the few percent level or more in models with strong enough winds, is within the reach of Spitzer measurements. Eclipse depth variability is thus a valuable tool to constrain the circulation regime and global wind speeds in hot Jupiter atmospheres.},

	abstract = {Idealized protoplanetary disk and giant planet formation models have been interpreted to suggest that a giant planet’s atmospheric abundances can be used to infer its formation location in its parent protoplanetary disk. It has recently been reported that the hot Jupiter WASP-77 A b has subsolar atmospheric carbon and oxygen abundances with a solar C/O abundance ratio. Assuming solar carbon and oxygen abundances for its host star WASP-77 A, WASP-77 A b’s atmospheric carbon and oxygen abundances possibly indicate that it accreted its envelope interior to its parent protoplanetary disk’s H2O ice line from carbon-depleted gas with little subsequent planetesimal accretion or core erosion. We show that the photospheric abundances of carbon and oxygen in WASP-77 A are supersolar with a subsolar C/O abundance ratio, implying that WASP-77 A b’s atmosphere has signiﬁcantly substellar carbon and oxygen abundances with a superstellar C/O ratio. Our result possibly indicates that WASP77 A b’s envelope was accreted by the planet beyond its parent protoplanetary diskʼs H2O ice line. While numerous theoretical complications to these idealized models have now been identiﬁed, the possibility of nonsolar protoplanetary disk abundance ratios confound even the most sophisticated protoplanetary disk and giant planet formation models. We therefore argue that giant planet atmospheric abundance ratios can only be meaningfully interpreted relative to the possibly nonsolar mean compositions of their parent protoplanetary disks as recorded in the photospheric abundances of their dwarf host stars.},

Currently mostly on the instrumental side, characterization bottlenecks will soon stand by the models used to translate spectra into atmospheric properties. Limitations stemming from our stellar and atmospheric models have already been highlighted. Here, we show that the current limitations of the opacity models used to decode exoplanet spectra propagate into an accuracy wall at {\textasciitilde}0.5-1.0 dex (i.e., 3 to 10x) on the atmospheric properties, which is an order of magnitude above the precision targeted by JWST Cycle 1 programs and needed for, e.g., meaningful C/O-ratio constraints and biosignatures identification. We perform a sensitivity analysis using nine different opacity models and find that most of the retrievals produce harmonious fits owing to compensations in the form of {\textgreater}5\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ biases on the derived atmospheric parameters translating in the aforementioned accuracy wall. We suggest a two-tier approach to alleviate this problem involving a new retrieval procedure and guided improvements in opacity data, their standardization and optimal dissemination.},

	abstract = {A model is presented for enhancing the abundance of solid material in the region of the solar nebula in which Jupiter formed, by diffusive redistribution and condensation of water vapor. A turbulent nebula is assumed with temperature decreasing roughly inversely with the radial distance from the center, and time scales set by turbulent viscosities taken from recent nebular models. The diffusion equation in cylindrical coordinates is solved in the limit that the sink of water vapor is condensation within a narrow radial zone approximately 5 AU from the center. Most of the water vapor is extracted from the terrestrial planet-forming zone. This “cold finger” solution is then justified by analytic solution of the diffusion equation in the condensation zone itself and inward and outward of that zone. The length scale over which most of the diffusively transported water vapor condenses is calculated to be ∼0.4 AU, provided the solids are not redistributed, and the surface density of ice in the formation zone of Jupiter is enhanced by as much as 75. The enhancement in surface density of solids is sufficient to trigger rapid accretion of planetesimals into a solid core along the lines of the model of Lissauer (1987,Icarus 69, 249–265), and hence produce Jupiter by nucleated instability on a time scale of approximately 105 to 106 years.},

	abstract = {Saturn formed beyond the snow line in the primordial solar nebula that made it possible for it to accrete a large mass. Disk instability and core accretion models have been proposed for Saturn's formation, but core accretion is favored on the basis of its volatile abundances, internal structure, hydrodynamic models, chemical characteristics of protoplanetary disk, etc. The observed frequency, properties and models of exoplanets provide additional supporting evidence for core accretion. The heavy elements with mass greater than 4He make up the core of Saturn, but are presently poorly constrained, except for carbon. The C/H ratio is super-solar, and twice that in Jupiter. The enrichment of carbon and other heavy elements in Saturn and Jupiter requires special delivery mechanisms for volatiles to these planets. In this chapter we will review our current understanding of the origin and evolution of Saturn and its atmosphere, using a multi-faceted approach that combines diverse sets of observations on volatile composition and abundances, relevant properties of the moons and rings, comparison with the other gas giant planet, Jupiter, analogies to the extrasolar giant planets, as well as pertinent theoretical models.},

However, previous studies have yielded inconsistent results because the small sizes of the spectral features and the limited information content of the data resulted in high sensitivity to the varying assumptions made in the treatment of instrument systematics and the atmospheric retrieval analysis. Here we present a dayside thermal emission spectrum of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-18b obtained with the NIRISS instrument on JWST. The data span 0.85 to 2.85 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m in wavelength at an average resolving power of 400 and exhibit minimal systematics. The spectrum shows three water emission features (at \${\textgreater}\$6\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ confidence) and evidence for optical opacity, possibly due to H\${\textasciicircum}-\$, TiO, and VO (combined significance of 3.8\${\textbackslash}sigma\$). Models that fit the data require a thermal inversion, molecular dissociation as predicted by chemical equilibrium, a solar heavy element abundance (''metallicity'', M/H = 1.03\$\_\{-0.51\}{\textasciicircum}\{+1.11\}\$ \${\textbackslash}times\$ solar), and a carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio less than unity.

Iron and silicate clouds shape the emergent spectra of L dwarfs, but these clouds dissipate at the L/T transition. A variety of other condensates are expected to form in cooler T dwarf atmospheres. These include Cr, MnS, Na2S, ZnS, and KCl, but the opacity of these optically thinner clouds has not been included in previous atmosphere models. Here, we examine their effect on model T and Y dwarf atmospheres. The cloud structures and opacities are calculated using the Ackerman \& Marley (2001) cloud model, which is coupled to an atmosphere model to produce atmospheric pressure-temperature proﬁles in radiative-convective equilibrium. We generate a suite of models between Teff = 400 and 1300 K, log g=4.0 and 5.5, and condensate sedimentation efﬁciencies from fsed=2 to 5. Model spectra are compared to two red T dwarfs, Ross 458C and UGPS 0722–05; models that include clouds are found to match observed spectra signiﬁcantly better than cloudless models. The emergence of sulﬁde clouds in cool atmospheres, particularly Na2S, may be a more natural explanation for the “cloudy” spectra of these objects, rather than the re-emergence of silicate clouds that wane at the L-to-T transition. We ﬁnd that sulﬁde clouds provide a mechanism to match the near- and mid-infrared colors of observed T dwarfs. Our results indicate that including the opacity of condensates in T dwarf atmospheres is necessary to accurately determine the physical characteristics of many of the observed objects.},

	abstract = {The formation of clouds affects brown dwarf and planetary atmospheres of nearly all effective temperatures. Iron and silicate condense in L dwarf atmospheres and dissipate at the L/T transition. Minor species such as sulﬁdes and salts condense in mid- to late T dwarfs. For brown dwarfs below Teff ∼ 450 K, water condenses in the upper atmosphere to form ice clouds. Currently, over a dozen objects in this temperature range have been discovered, and few previous theoretical studies have addressed the effect of water clouds on brown dwarf or exoplanetary spectra. Here we present a new grid of models that include the effect of water cloud opacity. We ﬁnd that they become optically thick in objects below Teff ∼ 350–375 K. Unlike refractory cloud materials, water-ice particles are signiﬁcantly nongray absorbers; they predominantly scatter at optical wavelengths through the J band and absorb in the infrared with prominent features, the strongest of which is at 2.8 μm. H2O, NH3, CH4, and H2 CIA are dominant opacity sources; less abundant species may also be detectable, including the alkalis, H2S, and PH3. PH3, which has been detected in Jupiter, is expected to have a strong signature in the mid-infrared at 4.3 μm in Y dwarfs around Teff = 450 K; if disequilibrium chemistry increases the abundance of PH3, it may be detectable over a wider effective temperature range than models predict. We show results incorporating disequilibrium nitrogen and carbon chemistry and predict signatures of low gravity in planetary mass objects. Finally, we make predictions for the observability of Y dwarfs and planets with existing and future instruments, including the James Webb Space Telescope and Gemini Planet Imager.},

	abstract = {The chemical species containing carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen in atmospheres of giant planets, brown dwarfs (T and L dwarfs), and low-mass stars (M dwarfs) are identified as part of a comprehensive set of thermochemical equilibrium and kinetic calculations for all elements. The calculations cover a wide temperature and pressure range in the upper portions of giant planetary and T-, L-, and M-dwarf atmospheres. Emphasis is placed on the major gases CH4, CO, NH3, N2, and H2O but other less abundant gases are included. The results presented are independent of particular model atmospheres, and can be used to constrain model atmosphere temperatures and pressures from observations of different gases. The influence of metallicity on the speciation of these key elements under pressure–temperature (P–T) conditions relevant to low-mass object atmospheres is discussed. The results of the thermochemical equilibrium computations indicate that several compounds may be useful to establish temperature or pressure scales for giant planet, brown dwarf, or dwarf star atmospheres. We find that ethane and methanol abundance are useful temperature probes in giant planets and methane dwarfs such as Gl 229B, and that CO2 can serve as a temperature probe in more massive objects. Imidogen (NH) abundances are a unique pressure-independent temperature probe for all objects. Total pressure probes for warmer brown dwarfs and M dwarfs are HCN, HCNO, and CH2O. No temperature-independent probes for the total pressure in giant planets or T-dwarf atmospheres are identified among the more abundant C, N, and O bearing gases investigated here.},

To date, most spectra have been observed for giant exoplanets due to which retrievals typically assume hydrogen-rich atmospheres. However, recent observations of mini Neptunes/super-Earths, and the promise of upcoming facilities including the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), call for a new generation of retrievals that can address a wide range of atmospheric compositions and related complexities. Here we report Aurora, a nextgeneration atmospheric retrieval framework that builds upon state-of-the-art architectures and incorporates the following key advancements: (a) a generalized compositional retrieval allowing for H-rich and H-poor atmospheres, (b) a generalized prescription for inhomogeneous clouds/hazes, (c) multiple Bayesian inference algorithms for high-dimensional retrievals, (d) modular considerations for refraction, forward scattering, and Mie scattering, and (e) noise modeling functionalities. We demonstrate Aurora on current and/or synthetic observations of the hot Jupiter HD 209458 b, mini Neptune K2-18b, and rocky exoplanet TRAPPIST-1 d. Using current HD 209458 b spectra, we demonstrate the robustness of our framework and cloud/haze prescription against assumptions of H-rich/H-poor atmospheres, improving on previous treatments. Using real and synthetic spectra of K2-18b, we demonstrate an agnostic approach to conﬁdently constrain its bulk atmospheric composition and obtain precise abundance estimates. For TRAPPIST-1 d, 10 JWST-NIRSpec transits can enable identiﬁcation of the main atmospheric component for cloud-free, CO2-rich, and N2-rich atmospheres and abundance constraints on trace gases, including initial indications of O3 if present at enhanced levels (∼10×–100× Earth levels).},

In this work we aim to determine if and how different methods for selecting populations of exoplanets for atmospheric characterization with JWST could inﬂuence population-level inferences. We generate three hypothetical surveys of super-Earths/sub-Neptunes, with each survey designed to span a similar radius-insolation ﬂux space. The survey samples are constructed based on three different selection criteria (evenly spaced by eye, binned, and a quantitative selection function). Using an injection-recovery technique, we test how robustly individual-planet atmospheric parameters and population-level parameters can be retrieved. We ﬁnd that all three survey designs result in equally suitable targets for individual atmospheric characterization, but not equally suitable targets for constraining population parameters. Only samples constructed with a quantitative method or that are sufﬁciently evenly spaced-by-eye result in robust population parameter constraints. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that the sample with the best targets for individual atmospheric study does not necessarily result in the best-constrained population parameters. The method of sample selection must be considered. We also ﬁnd that there may be large variability in population-level results with a sample that is small enough to ﬁt in a single JWST cycle (∼12 planets), suggesting that the most successful population-level analyses will be multicycle. Lastly, we infer that our exploration of sample selection is limited by the small number of transiting planets with measured masses around bright stars. Our results can guide future development of programs that aim to determine underlying trends in exoplanet-atmospheric properties, and, by extension, formation and evolution processes.},

	abstract = {Correlations between stellar properties and the occurrence rate of exoplanets can be used to inform the target selection of future planet search efforts and provide valuable clues about the planet formation process. We analyze a sample of 1194 stars drawn from the California Planet Survey targets to determine the empirical functional form describing the likelihood of a star harboring a giant planet as a function of its mass and metallicity. Our stellar sample ranges from M dwarfs with masses as low as 0.2 Msun to intermediate-mass subgiants with masses as high as 1.9 Msun. In agreement with previous studies, our sample exhibits a planet-metallicity correlation at all stellar masses; the fraction of stars that harbor giant planets scales as f {\textbackslash}propto 10{\textasciicircum}\{1.2 [Fe/H]\}. We can rule out a flat metallicity relationship among our evolved stars (at 98\% confidence), which argues that the high metallicities of stars with planets are not likely due to convective envelope "pollution." Our data also rule out a constant planet occurrence rate for [Fe/H]{\textless} 0, indicating that giant planets continue to become rarer at sub-Solar metallicities. We also find that planet occurrence increases with stellar mass (f {\textbackslash}propto Mstar), characterized by a rise from 3.5\% around M dwarfs (0.5 Msun) to 14\% around A stars (2 Msun), at Solar metallicity. We argue that the correlation between stellar properties and giant planet occurrence is strong supporting evidence of the core accretion model of planet formation.},

	abstract = {We study relations between stellar mass, star formation and gas-phase metallicity in a sample of 177 071 unique emission line galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7, as well as in a sample of 43 767 star-forming galaxies at z = 0 from the cosmological semianalytic model L-GALAXIES. We demonstrate that metallicity is dependent on star formation rate at ﬁxed mass, but that the trend is opposite for low and for high stellar mass galaxies. Lowmass galaxies that are actively forming stars are more metal poor than quiescent low-mass galaxies. High-mass galaxies, on the other hand, have lower gas-phase metallicities if their star formation rates are small. Remarkably, the same trends are found for our sample of model galaxies. By examining the evolution of the stellar component, gas and metals as a function of time in these galaxies, we gain some insight into the physical processes that may be responsible for these trends. We ﬁnd that massive galaxies with low gas-phase metallicities have undergone a gas-rich merger in the past, inducing a starburst which exhausted their cold gas reservoirs and shutdown star formation. Thereafter, these galaxies were able to accrete metal-poor gas, but this gas remained at too low a density to form stars efﬁciently. This led to a gradual dilution in the gas-phase metallicities of these systems over time. These model galaxies are predicted to have lower-than-average gas-to-stellar mass ratios and higher-than-average central black hole masses. We use our observational sample to conﬁrm that real massive galaxies with low gas-phase metallicities also have very massive black holes. We propose that accretion may therefore play a signiﬁcant role in regulating the gas-phase metallicities of present-day massive galaxies.},

We analyse the various components of the ISM probed by the mid-infrared observations and compare them with other Galactic and extragalactic objects. The MIR spectra of the low-metallicity starburst sources are dominated by the [Ne iii]λ15.56 µm and [S iv]λ10.51 µm lines, as well as a steeply rising dust continuum. PAH bands are generaly faint, both locally and averaged over the full galaxy, in stark contrast to dustier starburst galaxies, where the PAH features are very prominant and even dominate on global scales. The hardness of the modeled interstellar radiation ﬁelds for the dwarf galaxies increases as the presence of PAH band emission becomes less pronounced. The [Ne iii]/[Ne ii] ratios averaged over the full galaxy are strikingly high, often {\textgreater}10. Thus, the hard radiation ﬁelds are pronounced and pervasive. We ﬁnd a prominent correlation between the PAHs/VSGs and the [Ne iii]/[Ne ii] ratios for a wide range of objects, including the low metallicity galaxies as well as Galactic H ii regions and other metal-rich galaxies. This eﬀect is consistent with the hardness of the interstellar radiation ﬁeld playing a major role in the destruction of PAHs in the low metallicity ISM. We see a PAHs/VSGs and metallicity correlation, also found by Engelbracht et al. (2005, ApJ, 628, 29) for a larger survey. Combined eﬀects of metallicity and radiation ﬁeld seem to be playing important roles in the observed behavior of PAHs in the low metallicity systems.},

The non-detection of CH\$\_4\$, combined with a strong CO\$\_2\$ feature, favours atmospheric models with a super-solar atmospheric metallicity. An unanticipated absorption feature at 4\${\textbackslash}mu\$m is best explained by SO\$\_2\$ (2.7\${\textbackslash}sigma\$), which could be a tracer of atmospheric photochemistry. These observations demonstrate JWST's sensitivity to a rich diversity of exoplanet compositions and chemical processes.},

	abstract = {Measuring the metallicity and carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio in exoplanet atmospheres is a fundamental step towards constraining the dominant chemical processes at work and, if in equilibrium, revealing planet formation histories. Transmission spectroscopy provides the necessary means by constraining the abundances of oxygen- and carbon-bearing species; however, this requires broad wavelength coverage, moderate spectral resolution, and high precision that, together, are not achievable with previous observatories. Now that JWST has commenced science operations, we are able to observe exoplanets at previously uncharted wavelengths and spectral resolutions. Here we report time-series observations of the transiting exoplanet WASP-39b using JWST's Near InfraRed Camera (NIRCam). The long-wavelength spectroscopic and short-wavelength photometric light curves span 2.0 - 4.0 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m, exhibit minimal systematics, and reveal well-defined molecular absorption features in the planet's spectrum. Specifically, we detect gaseous H\$\_2\$O in the atmosphere and place an upper limit on the abundance of CH\$\_4\$. The otherwise prominent CO\$\_2\$ feature at 2.8 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m is largely masked by H\$\_2\$O. The best-fit chemical equilibrium models favour an atmospheric metallicity of 1-100\${\textbackslash}times\$ solar (i.e., an enrichment of elements heavier than helium relative to the Sun) and a sub-stellar carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio. The inferred high metallicity and low C/O ratio may indicate significant accretion of solid materials during planet formation or disequilibrium processes in the upper atmosphere.},

One of the targets from the ERO is HAT-P-18b, an inﬂated Saturn-mass planet with an equilibrium temperature of ∼850 K. We present the NIRISS/SOSS transmission spectrum of HAT-P-18b from 0.6 to 2.8 μm and reveal the planet in the infrared beyond 1.6 μm for the ﬁrst time. From the spectrum, we see clear water and escaping helium tail features in an otherwise very hazy atmosphere. Our free chemistry retrievals with ATMO show moderate Bayesian evidence (3.79) supporting the presence of methane, but the spectrum does not display any clearly identiﬁable methane absorption features. The retrieved methane abundance is ∼2 orders of magnitude lower than that of solar composition. The methane-depleted atmosphere strongly rejects simple equilibrium chemistry forward models with solar metallicity and a C/O ratio and disfavors high metallicity (100 times) and a low C/O ratio (0.3). This calls for additional physical processes such as vertical mixing and photochemistry, which can remove methane from the atmosphere.},

While the data were used primarily to verify that the NIRSpec BOTS mode is working as expected, and to enable it for general scientific use, they yield a precise transmission spectrum which we find is featureless down to the precision level of the instrument, consistent with expectations given HAT-P-14{\textasciitilde}b's small scale-height and hence expected atmospheric features. The exquisite quality and stability of the {\textbackslash}emph\{JWST/NIRSpec\} transit spectrum -- almost devoid of any systematic effects -- allowed us to obtain median uncertainties of 50-60 ppm in this wavelength range at a resolution of \$R=100\$ in a single exposure, which is in excellent agreement with pre-flight expectations and close to the (or at the) photon-noise limit for a \$J = 9.094\$, F-type star like HAT-P-14.

	abstract = {We address disequilibrium abundances of some simple molecules in the atmospheres of solar composition brown dwarfs and self-luminous extrasolar giant planets using a kinetics-based one-dimensional atmospheric chemistry model. Our approach is to use the full kinetics model to survey the parameter space with effective temperatures between 500 K and 1100 K. In all of these worlds, equilibrium chemistry favors CH4 over CO in the parts of the atmosphere that can be seen from Earth, but in most disequilibrium favors CO. The small surface gravity of a planet strongly discriminates against CH4 when compared to an otherwise comparable brown dwarf. If vertical mixing is like Jupiter's, the transition from methane to CO occurs at 500 K in a planet. Sluggish vertical mixing can raise this to 600 K, but clouds or more vigorous vertical mixing could lower this to 400 K. The comparable thresholds in brown dwarfs are 1100 ± 100 K. Ammonia is also sensitive to gravity, but, unlike CH4/CO, the NH3/N2 ratio is insensitive to mixing, which makes NH3 a potential proxy for gravity. HCN may become interesting in high-gravity brown dwarfs with very strong vertical mixing. Detailed analysis of the CO–CH4 reaction network reveals that the bottleneck to CO hydrogenation goes through methanol, in partial agreement with previous work. Simple, easy to use quenching relations are derived by fitting to the complete chemistry of the full ensemble of models. These relations are valid for determining CO, CH4, NH3, HCN, and CO2 abundances in the range of self-luminous worlds we have studied, but may not apply if atmospheres are strongly heated at high altitudes by processes not considered here (e.g., wave breaking).},

	abstract = {A primary goal of exoplanet characterization is to use a planet’s current composition to understand how that planet formed. For example, the C/O ratio has long been recognized as carrying important information on the chemistry of volatile species. Refractory elements, like Fe, Mg, and Si, are usually not considered in this conversation because they condense into solids like Fe(s) or MgSiO3 and would be removed from the observable, gaseous atmosphere in exoplanets cooler than about 2000 K. However, planets hotter than about 2000 K, called ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs), are warm enough to largely avoid the condensation of refractory species. In this paper, we explore the insight that the measurement of refractory abundances can provide into a planet’s origins. Through refractoryto-volatile elemental abundance ratios, we can estimate a planet’s atmospheric rock-to-ice fraction and constrain planet formation and migration scenarios. We ﬁrst relate a planet’s present-day refractory-to-volatile ratio to its rock-to-ice ratio from formation using various compositional models for the rocky and icy components of the protoplanetary disk. We discuss potential confounding factors like the sequestration of heavy metals in the core and condensation. We then show such a measurement using atmospheric retrievals of the low-resolution UV-IR transmission spectrum of WASP-121b with PETRA, from which we estimate a refractory-to-volatile ratio of 5.0-+26..70 ´ solar and a rock-to-ice ratio greater than 2/3. This result is consistent with signiﬁcant atmospheric enrichment by rocky planetismals. Lastly, we discuss the rich future potential for measuring refractory-to-volatile ratios in UHJs with the arrival of the James Webb Space Telescope and by combining observations at low and high resolution.},

It is constructed for gaseous chemistry from 500 to 2500 K, using a reduced C–H–O chemical network with about 300 reactions. It uses eddy diffusion to mimic atmospheric dynamics and excludes photochemistry. We have provided a full description of the rate coefﬁcients and thermodynamic data used. We validate VULCAN by reproducing chemical equilibrium and by comparing its output versus the disequilibriumchemistry calculations of Moses et al. and Rimmer \& Helling. It reproduces the models of HD 189733b and HD 209458b by Moses et al., which employ a network with nearly 1600 reactions. We also use VULCAN to examine the theoretical trends produced when the temperature–pressure proﬁle and carbon-to-oxygen ratio are varied. Assisted by a sensitivity test designed to identify the key reactions responsible for producing a speciﬁc molecule, we revisit the quenching approximation and ﬁnd that it is accurate for methane but breaks down for acetylene, because the disequilibrium abundance of acetylene is not directly determined by transport-induced quenching, but is rather indirectly controlled by the disequilibrium abundance of methane. Therefore we suggest that the quenching approximation should be used with caution and must always be checked against a chemical kinetics calculation. A one-dimensional model atmosphere with 100 layers, computed using VULCAN, typically takes several minutes to complete.

High resolution measurements of the helium triplet absorption of highly irradiated planets have been recently reported, which provide a new means of studying their atmospheric escape.

While HD 189733 b has a rather compressed atmosphere and small gas radial velocities, GJ 3470 b, on the other hand with a gravitational potential ten times smaller, exhibits a very extended atmosphere and large radial outflow velocities. Hence, although GJ 3470 b is much less irradiated in the X-ray and extreme ultraviolet radiation, and its upper atmosphere is much cooler, it evaporates at a comparable rate. In particular, we find that the upper atmosphere of HD 189733 b is compact and hot, with a maximum temperature of 12 400

	abstract = {The application of Bayesian methods in cosmology and astrophysics has flourished over the past decade, spurred by data sets of increasing size and complexity. In many respects, Bayesian methods have proven to be vastly superior to more traditional statistical tools, offering the advantage of higher efficiency and of a consistent conceptual basis for dealing with the problem of induction in the presence of uncertainty. This trend is likely to continue in the future, when the way we collect, manipulate and analyse observations and compare them with theoretical models will assume an even more central role in cosmology. This review is an introduction to Bayesian methods in cosmology and astrophysics and recent results in the field. I first present Bayesian probability theory and its conceptual underpinnings, Bayes' Theorem and the role of priors. I discuss the problem of parameter inference and its general solution, along with numerical techniques such as Monte Carlo Markov Chain methods. I then review the theory and application of Bayesian model comparison, discussing the notions of Bayesian evidence and effective model complexity, and how to compute and interpret those quantities. Recent developments in cosmological parameter extraction and Bayesian cosmological model building are summarized, highlighting the challenges that lie ahead.},

	abstract = {We explore CO CH4 quench kinetics in the atmospheres of substellar objects using updated timescale arguments, as suggested by a thermochemical kinetics and diffusion model that transitions from the thermochemical-equilibrium regime in the deep atmosphere to a quench-chemical regime at higher altitudes. More speciﬁcally, we examine CO quench chemistry on the T dwarf Gliese 229B and CH4 quench chemistry on the hot-Jupiter HD 189733b. We describe a method for correctly calculating reverse rate coefﬁcients for chemical reactions, discuss the predominant pathways for CO CH4 interconversion as indicated by the model, and demonstrate that a simple timescale approach can be used to accurately describe the behavior of quenched species when updated reaction kinetics and mixing-length-scale assumptions are used. Proper treatment of quench kinetics has important implications for estimates of molecular abundances and/or vertical mixing rates in the atmospheres of substellar objects. Our model results indicate signiﬁcantly higher Kzz values than previously estimated near the CO quench level on Gliese 229B, whereas current-model–data comparisons using CH4 permit a wide range of Kzz values on HD 189733b. We also use updated reaction kinetics to revise previous estimates of the Jovian water abundance, based upon the observed abundance and chemical behavior of carbon monoxide. The CO chemical/observational constraint, along with Galileo entry probe data, suggests a water abundance of approximately 0.51–2.6× solar (for a solar value of H2O/H2 = 9.61 × 10−4) in Jupiter’s troposphere, assuming vertical mixing from the deep atmosphere is the only source of tropospheric CO.},

Lofted aerosols and disequilibrium chemistry are caused by vigorous vertical transport in these heavily irradiated atmospheres. Here we numerically and analytically investigate how vertical transport should change over the parameter space of spin-synchronized gas giants. In order to understand how tracer transport depends on planetary parameters, we develop an analytic theory to predict vertical velocities and mixing rates (Kzz) and compare the results to our numerical experiments. We ﬁnd that both our theory and numerical simulations predict that if the vertical mixing rate is described by an eddy diffusivity, then this eddy diffusivity Kzz should increase with increasing equilibrium temperature, decreasing frictional drag strength, and increasing chemical loss timescales. We ﬁnd that the transition in our numerical simulations between circulation dominated by a superrotating jet and that with solely day-to-night ﬂow causes a marked change in the vertical velocity structure and tracer distribution. The mixing ratio of passive tracers is greatest for intermediate drag strengths that correspond to this transition between a superrotating jet with columnar vertical velocity structure and day-to-night ﬂow with upwelling on the dayside and downwelling on the nightside. Finally, we present analytic solutions for Kzz as a function of planetary effective temperature, chemical loss timescales, and other parameters, for use as input to 1D chemistry models of spin-synchronized gas giant atmospheres.},

We coupled a ﬂexible chemical kinetics scheme to the Met Ofﬁce Uniﬁed Model, which enables the study of the interaction of chemistry, radiative transfer, and ﬂuid dynamics. We used a newly-released “reduced” chemical network, comprising 30 chemical species, that was speciﬁcally developed for its application in 3D atmosphere models. We simulated the atmospheres of the well-studied hot Jupiters HD 209458b and HD 189733b which both have dayside–nightside temperature contrasts of several hundred Kelvin and superrotating equatorial jets. We ﬁnd qualitatively quite different chemical structures between the two planets, particularly for methane (CH4), when advection of chemical species is included. Our results show that consideration of 3D chemical transport is vital in understanding the chemical composition of hot Jupiter atmospheres. Three-dimensional mixing leads to signiﬁcant changes in the abundances of absorbing gas-phase species compared with what would be expected by assuming local chemical equilibrium, or from models including 1D – and even 2D – chemical mixing. We ﬁnd that CH4, carbon dioxide (CO2), and ammonia (NH3) are particularly interesting as 3D mixing of these species leads to prominent signatures of out-of-equilibrium chemistry in the transmission and emission spectra, which are detectable with near-future instruments.},

This effect, typically neglected in general circulation models (GCMs), has been suggested to explain discrepancies between observed infrared light curves and those predicted by GCMs. On the nightsides of several hot Jupiters, GCMs predict outgoing ﬂuxes that are too large, especially in the Spitzer4.5 μm band. We modiﬁed the SPARC/MITgcm to include disequilibrium abundances of CH4, CO, and H2O by assuming that the CH4/CO ratio is constant throughout the simulation domain. We ran simulations of hot Jupiter HD 189733b with eight CH4/CO ratios. In the more likely COdominated regime, we ﬁnd temperature changes 50–100 K compared to the simulation for equilibrium chemistry across large regions. This effect is large enough to affect predicted emission spectra and should thus be included in GCMs of hot Jupiters with equilibrium temperatures between 600 and 1300 K. We ﬁnd that spectra in regions with strong methane absorption, including the Spitzer3.6 and 8 μm bands, are strongly impacted by disequilibrium abundances. We expect chemical quenching to result in much larger nightside ﬂuxes in the 3.6 μm band, in stark contrast to observations. Meanwhile, we ﬁnd almost no effect on predicted observations in the 4.5 μm band, because the changes in opacity due to CO and H2O offset each other. We thus conclude that disequilibrium carbon chemistry cannot explain the observed low nightside ﬂuxes in the 4.5 μm band.},

	abstract = {Chemical equilibrium considerations suggest that, assuming solar elemental abundances, carbon on HD 209458b is sequestered primarily as carbon monoxide (CO) and methane (CH4). The relative mole fractions of CO(g) and CH4(g) in chemical equilibrium are expected to vary greatly according to variations in local temperature and pressure. We show, however, that in the p ¼ 1Y1000 mbar range, chemical equilibrium does not hold. To explore disequilibrium effects, we couple the chemical kinetics of CO and CH4 to a three-dimensional numerical model of HD 209458b’s atmospheric circulation. These simulations show that vigorous dynamics caused by uneven heating of this tidally locked planet homogenize the CO and CH4 concentrations at p {\textless} 1 bar, even in the presence of lateral temperature variations of \$500Y1000 K. In the 1Y1000 mbar pressure range we ﬁnd that over 98\% of the carbon is in CO. This is true even in cool regions where CH4 is much more stable thermodynamically. Our work shows, furthermore, that planets 300Y500 K cooler than HD 209458b can also have abundant CO in their upper layers due to disequilibrium effects. We demonstrate several interesting observational consequences of these results.},

	abstract = {Recent observations of the transiting super-Earth GJ 1214b reveal that its atmosphere may be hydrogen-rich or water-rich in nature, with clouds or hazes potentially affecting its transmission spectrum in the optical and very-near-IR. Here we further examine the possibility that GJ 1214b does indeed possess a hydrogen-dominated atmosphere, which is the hypothesis that is favored by models of the bulk composition of the planet. We study the effects of non-equilibrium chemistry (photochemistry, thermal chemistry, and mixing) on the planet's transmission spectrum. We furthermore examine the possibility that clouds could play a significant role in attenuating GJ 1214b's transmission spectrum at short wavelengths. We find that non-equilibrium chemistry can have a large effect on the overall chemical composition of GJ 1214b's atmosphere, however these changes mostly take place above the height in the atmosphere that is probed by transmission spectroscopy. The effects of non-equilibrium chemistry on GJ 1214b's transmission spectrum are therefore minimal, with the largest effects taking place if the planet's atmosphere has super-solar metallicity and a low rate of vertical mixing. Interestingly, we find that the best fit to the observations of GJ 1214b's atmosphere in transmission occur if the planet's atmosphere is deficient in CH4, and possesses a cloud layer at a pressure of {\textasciitilde}200 mbar. This is consistent with a picture of efficient methane photolysis, accompanied by formation of organic haze that obscures the lower atmosphere of GJ 1214b at optical wavelengths. However, for methane to be absent from GJ 1214b's transmission spectrum, UV photolysis of this molecule must be efficient at pressures of greater than {\textasciitilde}1 mbar, whereas we find that methane only photolyzes to pressures less than 0.1 mbar, even under the most optimistic assumptions.

	abstract = {A detailed model is presented of methane photochemistry in the primitive terrestrial atmosphere along with speculation about its interpretation. Steady-state CH4 mixing ratios of 10−6–10−4 could have been maintained by a methane source of about 1011 cm−2 s−1, which is comparable to the modern biogenic methane production rate. In the absence of a source, methane would have disappeared in {\textless}104 years, being either oxidized, or polymerized into more complex hydrocarbons. The source strength needed to maintain a steady CH4 mixing ratio and the degree to which methane could have polymerized to form higher hydrocarbons depend upon the amount of CO2 present in the early atmosphere. The dependence on H2 is much weaker. Infrared absorption by methane, and especially by other hydrocarbon species, may have supplemented the greenhouse warming due to carbon dioxide. A radiative model is needed to establish this effect quantitatively. The destruction of the methane greenhouse early in the Proterozoic may have triggered the Huronian glaciation. These calculations also suggest that atmospheres rich in both CO2 and CH4 may be photochemically unstable with respect to conversion to CO.},

Here we investigate the coupled chemistry of neutral carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen species on HD 189733b and HD 209458b and we compare the model results with existing transit and eclipse observations. We ﬁnd that the vertical proﬁles of molecular constituents are signiﬁcantly affected by transport-induced quenching and photochemistry, particularly on the cooler HD 189733b; however, the warmer stratospheric temperatures on HD 209458b help maintain thermochemical equilibrium and reduce the effects of disequilibrium chemistry. For both planets, the methane and ammonia mole fractions are found to be enhanced over their equilibrium values at pressures of a few bar to less than an mbar due to transport-induced quenching, but CH4 and NH3 are photochemically removed at higher altitudes. Disequilibrium chemistry also enhances atomic species, unsaturated hydrocarbons (particularly C2H2), some nitriles (particularly HCN), and radicals like OH, CH3, and NH2. In contrast, CO, H2O, N2, and CO2 more closely follow their equilibrium proﬁles, except at pressures 1 μbar, where CO, H2O, and N2 are photochemically destroyed and CO2 is produced before its eventual high-altitude destruction. The enhanced abundances of CH4, NH3, and HCN are expected to affect the spectral signatures and thermal proﬁles of HD 189733b and other relatively cool, transiting exoplanets. We examine the sensitivity of our results to the assumed temperature structure and eddy diffusion coefﬁcients and discuss further observational consequences of these models.},

	abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a key chemical species that is found in a wide range of planetary atmospheres. In the context of exoplanets, CO2 is an indicator of the metal enrichment (i.e., elements heavier than helium, also called "metallicity"), and thus formation processes of the primary atmospheres of hot gas giants. It is also one of the most promising species to detect in the secondary atmospheres of terrestrial exoplanets. Previous photometric measurements of transiting planets with the Spitzer Space Telescope have given hints of the presence of CO2 but have not yielded definitive detections due to the lack of unambiguous spectroscopic identification. Here we present the detection of CO2 in the atmosphere of the gas giant exoplanet WASP-39b from transmission spectroscopy observations obtained with JWST as part of the Early Release Science Program (ERS). The data used in this study span 3.0 to 5.5 \{{\textbackslash}mu\}m in wavelength and show a prominent CO2 absorption feature at 4.3 \{{\textbackslash}mu\}m (26\{{\textbackslash}sigma\} significance). The overall spectrum is well matched by one-dimensional, 10x solar metallicity models that assume radiative-convective-thermochemical equilibrium and have moderate cloud opacity. These models predict that the atmosphere should have water, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen sulfide in addition to CO2, but little methane. Furthermore, we also tentatively detect a small absorption feature near 4.0 \{{\textbackslash}mu\}m that is not reproduced by these models.},

These super-Earths and sub-Neptunes probably represent the most common outcome of planet formation1,2. Mass and radius measurements indicate a diversity in bulk composition much wider than for gas giants3; however, direct spectroscopic detections of molecular absorption and constraints on the gas mixing ratios have largely remained limited to planets more massive than Neptune4–6. Here we analyse a combined Hubble/Spitzer Space Telescope dataset of 12 transits and 20 eclipses of the sub-Neptune exoplanet GJ 3470 b, whose mass of 12.6 M⊕ places it near the halfway point between previously studied Neptune-like exoplanets (22–23 M⊕)5–7 and exoplanets known to have rocky densities (7 M⊕)8. Obtained over many years, our dataset provides a robust detection of water absorption ({\textgreater}5σ) and a thermal emission detection from the lowest irradiated planet to date. We reveal a low-metallicity, hydrogen-dominated atmosphere similar to that of a gas giant, but strongly depleted in methane gas. The low metallicity (O/H = 0.2–18.0) sets important constraints on the potential planet formation processes at low masses as well as the subsequent accretion of solids. The low methane abundance indicates that methane is destroyed much more efficiently than previously predicted, suggesting that the CH4/CO transition curve has to be revisited for close-in planets. Finally, we also find a sharp drop in the cloud opacity at 2–3 µm, characteristic of Mie scattering, which enables narrow constraints on the cloud particle size and makes GJ 3470 b a key target for mid-infrared characterization with the James Webb Space Telescope.},

              The metastable helium line at 1083 nm can be used to probe the extended upper atmospheres of close-in exoplanets and thus provide insight into their atmospheric mass loss, which is likely to be significant in sculpting their population. We used an ultra-narrow band filter centered on this line to observe two transits of the low-density gas giant HAT-P-18b, using the 200″ Hale Telescope at Palomar Observatory, and report the detection of its extended upper atmosphere.

	abstract = {The atmospheric pressure–temperature proﬁles for transiting giant planets cross a range of chemical transitions. Here we show that the particular shapes of these irradiated proﬁles for warm giant planets below ∼1300 K lead to striking differences in the behavior of nonequilibrium chemistry compared to brown dwarfs of similar temperatures. Our particular focus is H2O, CO, CH4, CO2, and NH3 in Jupiter- and Neptune-class planets. We show that the cooling history of a planet, which depends most signiﬁcantly on planetary mass and age, can have a dominant effect on abundances in the visible atmosphere, often swamping trends one might expect based on Teq alone. The onset of detectable CH4 in spectra can be delayed to lower Teq for some planets compared to equilibrium, or pushed to higher Teq. The detectability of NH3 is typically enhanced compared to equilibrium expectations, which is opposite to the brown dwarf case. We ﬁnd that both CH4 and NH3 can become detectable at around the same Teq (at Teq values that vary with mass and metallicity), whereas these “onset” temperatures are widely spaced for brown dwarfs. We suggest observational strategies to search for atmospheric trends and stress that nonequilibrium chemistry and clouds can serve as probes of atmospheric physics. As examples of atmospheric complexity, we assess three Neptune-class planets, GJ 436b, GJ 3470b, and WASP-107, all around Teq=700 K. Tidal heating due to eccentricity damping in all three planets heats the deep atmosphere by thousands of degrees and may explain the absence of CH4 in these cool atmospheres. Atmospheric abundances must be interpreted in the context of physical characteristics of the planet.},

The additional new features are advection transport, condensation, various boundary conditions, and temperature-dependent UV cross sections. First, we validate our photochemical model for hot Jupiter atmospheres by performing an intercomparison of HD 189733b models between Moses et al., Venot et al., and VULCAN, to diagnose possible sources of discrepancy. Second, we set up a model of Jupiter extending from the deep troposphere to upper stratosphere to verify the kinetics for low temperature. Our model reproduces hydrocarbons consistent with observations, and the condensation scheme successfully predicts the locations of water and ammonia ice clouds. We show that vertical advection can regulate the local ammonia distribution in the deep atmosphere. Third, we validate the model for oxidizing atmospheres by simulating Earth and ﬁnd agreement with observations. Last, VULCAN is applied to four representative cases of extrasolar giant planets: WASP-33b, HD 189733b, GJ 436b, and 51 Eridani b. We look into the effects of the C/O ratio and chemistry of titanium/ vanadium species for WASP-33b, we revisit HD 189733b for the effects of sulfur and carbon condensation, the effects of internal heating and vertical mixing (Kzz) are explored for GJ 436b, and we test updated planetary properties for 51 Eridani b with S8 condensates. We ﬁnd that sulfur can couple to carbon or nitrogen and impact other species, such as hydrogen, methane, and ammonia. The observable features of the synthetic spectra and trends in the photochemical haze precursors are discussed for each case.},

	abstract = {Methane has been proposed as an exoplanet biosignature. Imminent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope may enable methane detections on potentially habitable exoplanets, so it is essential to assess in what planetary contexts methane is a compelling biosignature. Methane's short photochemical lifetime in terrestrial planet atmospheres implies that abundant methane requires large replenishment fluxes. While methane can be produced by a variety of abiotic mechanisms such as outgassing, serpentinizing reactions, and impacts, we argue that, in contrast to an Earth-like biosphere, known abiotic processes cannot easily generate atmospheres rich in CH\$\_4\$ and CO\$\_2\$ with limited CO due to the strong redox disequilibrium between CH\$\_4\$ and CO\$\_2\$. Methane is thus more likely to be biogenic for planets with 1) a terrestrial bulk density, high mean-molecular-weight and anoxic atmosphere, and an old host star; 2) an abundance of CH\$\_4\$ that implies surface fluxes exceeding what could be supplied by abiotic processes; and 3) atmospheric CO\$\_2\$ with comparatively little CO.},

These SEDs are composites of Chandra or XMM-Newton data from 5–∼50 Å, a plasma emission model from ∼50–100 Å, broadband empirical estimates from 100–1170 Å, Hubble Space Telescope data from 1170–5700 Å, including a reconstruction of stellar Lyα emission at 1215.67 Å, and a PHOENIX model spectrum from 5700–55000 Å. Using these SEDs, we computed the photodissociation rates of several molecules prevalent in planetary atmospheres when exposed to each star’s unattenuated ﬂux (“unshielded” photodissociation rates) and found that rates differ among stars by over an order of magnitude for most molecules. In general, the same spectral regions drive unshielded photodissociations both for the minimally and maximally FUV active stars. However, for O3 visible ﬂux drives dissociation for the M stars whereas near-UV ﬂux drives dissociation for the K stars. We also searched for an far-UV continuum in the assembled SEDs and detected it in 5/11 stars, where it contributes around 10\% of the ﬂux in the range spanned by the continuum bands. An ultraviolet continuum shape is resolved for the star  Eri that shows an edge likely attributable to Si II recombination. The 11 SEDs presented in this paper, available online through the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes, will be valuable for vetting stellar upper-atmosphere emission models and simulating photochemistry in exoplanet atmospheres.},

	abstract = {The ultraviolet (UV) spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of low-mass (K- and M-type) stars play a critical role in the heating and chemistry of exoplanet atmospheres, but are not observationally well-constrained. Direct observations of the intrinsic ﬂux of the Lyα line (the dominant source of UV photons from low-mass stars) are challenging, as interstellar H I absorbs the entire line core for even the closest stars. To address the existing gap in empirical constraints on the UV ﬂux of K and M dwarfs, the MUSCLES Hubble Space Telescope Treasury Survey has obtained UV observations of 11 nearby M and K dwarfs hosting exoplanets. This paper presents the Lyα and extreme-UV spectral reconstructions for the MUSCLES targets. Most targets are optically inactive, but all exhibit signiﬁcant UV activity. We use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique to correct the observed Lyα proﬁles for interstellar absorption, and we employ empirical relations to compute the extreme-UV SED from the intrinsic Lyα ﬂux in ∼100 Å bins from 100–1170 Å. The reconstructed Lyα proﬁles have 300 km s−1 broad cores, while {\textgreater}1\% of the total intrinsic Lyα ﬂux is measured in extended wings between 300 and 1200 km s−1. The Lyα surface ﬂux positively correlates with the Mg II surface ﬂux and negatively correlates with the stellar rotation period. Stars with larger Lyα surface ﬂux also tend to have larger surface ﬂux in ions formed at higher temperatures, but these correlations remain statistically insigniﬁcant in our sample of 11 stars. We also present H I column density measurements for 10 new sightlines through the local interstellar medium.},

	abstract = {Atmospheric escape is considered to be one of the main channels for evolution in sub-Jovian planets, particularly in their early lives. While there are several hypotheses proposed to explain escape in exoplanets, testing them with atmospheric observations remains a challenge. In this context, high-resolution transmission spectroscopy of transiting exoplanets for the metastable helium triplet (He 23S) at 1083 nm has emerged as a reliable technique for observing and measuring escape. To aid in the prediction and interpretation of metastable He transmission spectroscopy observations, we developed the code p-winds. This is an open-source, fully documented, scalable Python implementation of the one-dimensional, purely H+He Parker wind model for upper atmospheres coupled with ionization balance, ray-tracing, and radiative transfer routines. We demonstrate an atmospheric retrieval by ﬁtting p-winds models to the observed metastable He transmission spectrum of the warm Neptune HAT-P-11 b and take the variation in the in-transit absorption caused by transit geometry into account. For this planet, our best ﬁt yields a total atmospheric escape rate of approximately 2.5 × 1010 g s−1 and an outﬂow temperature of 7200 K. The range of retrieved mass loss rates increases signiﬁcantly when we let the H atom fraction be a free parameter, but its posterior distribution remains unconstrained by He observations alone. The stellar host limb darkening does not have a signiﬁcant impact on the retrieved escape rate or outﬂow temperature for HAT-P-11 b. Based on the non-detection of escaping He for GJ 436 b, we are able to rule out total escape rates higher than 3.4 × 1010 g s−1 at 99.7\% (3σ) conﬁdence.},

	abstract = {Methods. Observations were performed during ﬁve transit events of HD 189733 b. By comparison of the in-transit and out-of-transit GIANO-B observations, we computed high-resolution transmission spectra. We then used them to perform equivalent width measurements and carry out light-curves analyses in order to consistently gauge the excess in-transit absorption in correspondence with the He I triplet.
Results. We spectrally resolve the He I triplet and detect an absorption signal during all ﬁve transits. The mean in-transit absorption depth amounts to 0.75 ± 0.03\% (25σ) in the core of the strongest helium triplet component. We detect night-to-night variations in the He I absorption signal likely due to the transit events occurring in the presence of stellar surface inhomogeneities. We evaluate the impact of stellar-activity pseudo-signals on the true planetary absorption using a comparative analysis of the He I 1083.3 nm (in the near-infrared) and the Hα (in the visible) lines. Using a 3D atmospheric code, we interpret the time series of the He I absorption lines in the three nights not affected by stellar contamination, which exhibit a mean in-transit absorption depth of 0.77 ± 0.04\% (19σ) in full agreement with the one derived from the full dataset. In agreement with previous results, our simulations suggest that the helium layers only ﬁll part of the Roche lobe. Observations can be explained with a thermosphere heated to ∼12 000 K, expanding up to ∼1.2 planetary radii, and losing ∼1 g s−1 of metastable helium.
Conclusions. Our results reinforce the importance of simultaneous optical plus near infrared monitoring when performing highresolution transmission spectroscopy of the extended and escaping atmospheres of hot planets in the presence of stellar activity.},

Observations of transiting exoplanets in the triplet of metastable helium lines at 10830 A allow extended atmospheres and escape processes to be studied for individual planets. We observed one transit of WASP-107b with NIRSPEC on Keck at 10830 A. Our observations, for the first time, had significant post-transit phase coverage, and we detected excess absorption for over an hour after fourth contact. The data can be explained by a comet-like tail extending out to {\textasciitilde}7 planet radii, which corresponds to roughly twice the Roche lobe radius of the planet. Planetary tails are expected based on 3D simulations of escaping exoplanet atmospheres, particularly those including the interaction between the escaped material and strong stellar winds, and have been previously observed at 10830 A, in at least one other exoplanet. With both the largest mid-transit absorption signal and the most extended tail observed at 10830 A, WASP-107b remains a keystone exoplanet for atmospheric escape studies.},

The result of improved stellar characteristics is a more accurate representation of this Kepler exoplanet sample and identiﬁcation of promising candidates for more detailed study. This stellar sample, particularly among stars with Teff 5200 K, includes a greater number of relatively evolved stars with larger radii than assumed by the mission on the basis of multi-color broadband photometry. About 26\% of the modeled stars require radii to be revised upward by a factor of 1.35 or greater, and modeling of 87\% of the stars suggest some increase in radius. The sample presented here also exhibits a change in the incidence of planets larger than 3–4 R⊕ as a function of metallicity. Once [Fe/H] increases to −0.05, large planets suddenly appear in the sample while smaller planets are found orbiting stars with a wider range of metallicity.

Our main scientiﬁc ﬁndings are (1) an upper limit on the variability of the dayside planet ﬂux of 2.7\% (68\% conﬁdence); (2) the most precise set of transit times measured for a transiting planet, with an average accuracy of 3 s; (3) a lack of transit-timing variations, excluding the presence of second planets in this system above 20\% of the mass of Mars in low-order mean-motion resonance at 95\% conﬁdence; (4) a conﬁrmation of the planet’s phase variation, ﬁnding the night side is 64\% as bright as the day side, as well as an upper limit on the nightside variability of 17\% (68\% conﬁdence); (5) a better correction for stellar variability at 8 μm causing the phase function to peak 3.5 hr before secondary eclipse, conﬁrming that the advection and radiation timescales are comparable at the 8 μm photosphere; (6) variation in the depth of transit, which possibly implies variations in the surface brightness of the portion of the star occulted by the planet, posing a fundamental limit on non-simultaneous multi-wavelength transit absorption measurements of planet atmospheres; (7) a measurement of the infrared limb darkening of the star, which is in good agreement with stellar atmosphere models; (8) an offset in the times of secondary eclipse of 69 s, which is mostly accounted for by a 31 s light-travel time delay and 33 s delay due to the shift of ingress and egress by the planet hot spot; this conﬁrms that the phase variation is due to an offset hot spot on the planet; (9) a retraction of the claimed eccentricity of this system due to the offset of secondary eclipse, which is now just an upper limit; and (10) high-precision measurements of the parameters of this system.

For instance, stellar companions may have facilitated the inward migration of hot Jupiters toward to their present day positions. Many observed short-period gas giant planets also have orbits that are misaligned with respect to their star’s spin axis, which has also been attributed to the presence of a massive outer companion on a non-coplanar orbit. We present the results of a multi-band direct imaging survey using Keck NIRC2 to measure the fraction of short-period gas giant planets found in multi-star systems. Over three years, we completed a survey of 50 targets (“Friends of Hot Jupiters”) with 27 targets showing some signature of multi-body interaction (misaligned or eccentric orbits) and 23 targets in a control sample (well-aligned and circular orbits). We report the masses, projected separations, and conﬁrmed common proper motion for the 19 stellar companions found around 17 stars. Correcting for survey incompleteness, we report companion fractions of 48\% ± 9\%, 47\% ± 12\%, and 51\% ± 13\% in our total, misaligned/eccentric, and control samples, respectively. This total stellar companion fraction is 2.8σ larger than the fraction of ﬁeld stars with companions approximately 50–2000 AU. We observe no correlation between misaligned/eccentric hot Jupiter systems and the incidence of stellar companions. Combining this result with our previous radial velocity survey, we determine that 72\% ± 16\% of hot Jupiters are part of multi-planet and/or multi-star systems.},

	abstract = {Methods. The raw data collected with the Gaia instruments during the ﬁrst 22 months of the mission have been processed by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) and turned into this second data release, which represents a major advance with respect to Gaia DR1 in terms of completeness, performance, and richness of the data products.
Results. Gaia DR2 contains celestial positions and the apparent brightness in G for approximately 1.7 billion sources. For 1.3 billion of those sources, parallaxes and proper motions are in addition available. The sample of sources for which variability information is provided is expanded to 0.5 million stars. This data release contains four new elements: broad-band colour information in the form of the apparent brightness in the GBP (330–680 nm) and GRP (630–1050 nm) bands is available for 1.4 billion sources; median radial velocities for some 7 million sources are presented; for between 77 and 161 million sources estimates are provided of the stellar effective temperature, extinction, reddening, and radius and luminosity; and for a pre-selected list of 14 000 minor planets in the solar system epoch astrometry and photometry are presented. Finally, Gaia DR2 also represents a new materialisation of the celestial reference frame in the optical, the Gaia-CRF2, which is the ﬁrst optical reference frame based solely on extragalactic sources. There are notable changes in the photometric system and the catalogue source list with respect to Gaia DR1, and we stress the need to consider the two data releases as independent.
Conclusions. Gaia DR2 represents a major achievement for the Gaia mission, delivering on the long standing promise to provide parallaxes and proper motions for over 1 billion stars, and representing a ﬁrst step in the availability of complementary radial velocity and source astrophysical information for a sample of stars in the Gaia survey which covers a very substantial fraction of the volume of our galaxy.},

Differential spectroscopy over an entire night was carried out at a resolution of R ≈ 400 using a nearby comparison star. We detect a blueward slope extending across our optical transmission spectrum that runs from 4750 to 9250 Å. The slope is consistent with Rayleigh scattering at the equilibrium temperature of the planet (852 K). We do not detect enhanced sodium absorption, which indicates that a high-altitude haze is masking the feature and giving rise to the Rayleigh slope. This is only the second discovery of a Rayleigh-scattering slope in a hot Jupiter atmosphere from the ground, and our study illustrates how ground-based observations can provide transmission spectra with precision comparable to the Hubble Space Telescope.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11865},
	abstract = {Transit surveys indicate that there is a deficit of Neptune-sized planets on close-in orbits. If this ``Neptune desert' is entirely cleared out by atmospheric mass loss, then planets at its upper edge should only be marginally stable against photoevaporation, exhibiting strong outflow signatures in tracers like the metastable helium triplet. We test this hypothesis by carrying out a 12-night photometric survey of the metastable helium feature with Palomar/WIRC, targeting seven gas-giant planets orbiting K-type host stars. Eight nights of data are analyzed here for the first time along with reanalyses of four previously-published datasets. We strongly detect helium absorption signals for WASP-69b, HAT-P-18b, and HAT-P-26b; tentatively detect signals for WASP-52b and NGTS-5b; and do not detect signals for WASP-177b and WASP-80b. We interpret these measured excess absorption signals using grids of Parker wind models to derive mass-loss rates, which are in good agreement with predictions from the hydrodynamical outflow code ATES for all planets except WASP-52b and WASP-80b, where our data suggest that the outflows are much smaller than predicted. Excluding these two planets, the outflows for the rest of the sample are consistent with a mean energy-limited outflow efficiency of \${\textbackslash}varepsilon = 0.41{\textasciicircum}\{+0.16\}\_\{-0.13\}\$. Even when we make the relatively conservative assumption that gas-giant planets experience energy-limited outflows at this efficiency for their entire lives, photoevaporation would still be too inefficient to carve the upper boundary of the Neptune desert. We conclude that this feature of the exoplanet population is a pristine tracer of giant planet formation and migration mechanisms.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13099},
	abstract = {We use Keck/NIRSPEC to survey a sample of of young (\${\textless}\$1 Gyr), short period mini Neptunes orbiting nearby K dwargs to measure their mass loss via the metastable helium line. We detect helium absorption from all four of the targets in our initial sample. The first detection, around TOI 560b, was announced in a previous paper. We now announce three additional detections around TOI 1430.01, 2076b, and TOI 1683.01. All four planets show an average in-transit excess absorption of 0.7--1.0\%. However, the outflows differ in their kinematic properties. TOI 1430b exhibits pre-ingress absorption, while TOI 2076b's outflow is exceptionally optically thick and shows significant post-egress absorption. For all four planets, the width of the measured helium absorption signal is consistent with expectations for a photoevaporative outflow (10--30 km/s, 5000--10,000 K). Unless broadening mechanisms other than thermal velocity and the bulk outflow velocity are significant, our observations disfavor core-powered mass loss models, which predict much slower (1-3 km/s) outflows. We utilize both an isothermal Parker wind model and an order-of-magnitude method to estimate the mass loss timescale, and obtain \${\textbackslash}sim\$ a few hundred Myr for each planet. We conclude that many, if not all, of these planets will lose their hydrogen-rich envelopes and become super Earths. Our results demonstrate that most mini Neptunes orbiting sun-like stars have primordial atmospheres, and that photoevaporation is an efficient mechanism for stripping these atmospheres and transforming these planets into super Earths.},

	abstract = {The core accretion theory for giant planet formation predicts enrichment of elemental abundances in planetary envelopes caused by runaway accretion of planetesimals, which is consistent with measured super-solar abundances of C, N, P, S, Xe, and Ar in Jupiter’s atmosphere. However, the abundance of O, which is expected to be the most dominant constituent of planetesimals, is unknown for solar system giant planets, owing to the condensation of water in their ultra-cold atmospheres, thereby posing a key unknown in solar system formation. On the other hand, hundreds of extrasolar “hot Jupiters” are known with very high temperatures ( 1000 K), making them excellent targets to measure H2O abundances and, hence, oxygen in their atmospheres. We constrain the atmospheric H2O abundances in three hot Jupiters (HD 189733b, HD 209458b, and WASP-12b), spanning a wide temperature range (1200–2500 K), using their near-infrared transmission spectra obtained using the Wide Field Camera 3 instrument on board the Hubble Space Telescope. We report conclusive measurements of H2O in HD 189733b and HD 209458b, while that in WASP-12b is not well constrained by present data. The data allow nearly solar as well as signiﬁcantly sub-solar abundances in HD 189733b and WASP-12b. However, for HD 209458b, we report the most precise H2O measurement in an exoplanet to date that suggests a ∼20–135× sub-solar H2O abundance. We discuss the implications of our results on the formation conditions of hot Jupiters and on the likelihood of clouds in their atmospheres. Our results highlight the critical importance of high-precision spectra of hot Jupiters for deriving their H2O abundances.},

	abstract = {The nature of the thermal structure of hot Jupiter atmospheres is one of the key questions raised by the characterization of transiting exoplanets over the past decade. There have been claims that many hot Jupiters exhibit atmospheric thermal inversions. However, these claims have been based on broadband photometry rather than the unambiguous identiﬁcation of emission features with spectroscopy, and the chemical species that could cause the thermal inversions by absorbing stellar irradiation at high altitudes have not been identiﬁed despite extensive theoretical and observational effort. Here we present high-precision Hubble Space Telescope WFC3 observations of the dayside thermal emission spectrum of the hot Jupiter HD 209458b, which was the ﬁrst exoplanet suggested to have a thermal inversion. In contrast to previous results for this planet, our observations detect water in absorption at 6.2σ conﬁdence. When combined with Spitzer photometry, the data are indicative of a monotonically decreasing temperature with pressure over the range of 1–0.001 bars at 7.7σ conﬁdence. We test the robustness of our results by exploring a variety of model assumptions, including the temperature proﬁle parameterization, presence of a cloud, and choice of Spitzer data reduction. We also introduce a new analysis method to determine the elemental abundances from the spectrally retrieved mixing ratios with thermochemical self-consistency and ﬁnd plausible abundances consistent with solar metallicity (0.06–10×solar) and carbon-tooxygen ratios less than unity. This work suggests that high-precision spectrophotometric results are required to robustly infer thermal structures and compositions of extrasolar planet atmospheres and to perform comparative exoplanetology.},

	abstract = {Secondary eclipse spectroscopy provides invaluable insights into the temperatures and compositions of exoplanetary atmospheres. We carry out a systematic temperature and abundance retrieval analysis of nine exoplanets (HD 189733b, HD 209458b, HD 149026b, GJ436b, WASP-12b, WASP-19b, WASP-43b, TrES-2b, and TrES3b) observed in secondary eclipse using a combination of space- and ground-based facilities. Our goal with this analysis is to provide a consistent set of temperatures and compositions from which self-consistent models can be compared and to probe the underlying processes that shape these atmospheres. This paper is the second in a three part series of papers exploring the retrievability of temperatures and abundances from secondary eclipse spectra and the implications of these results for the chemistry of exoplanet atmospheres. In this investigation we present a catalogue of temperatures and abundances for H2O, CH4, CO, and CO2. We ﬁnd that our temperatures and abundances are generally consistent with those of previous studies, although we do not ﬁnd any statistically convincing evidence for super-solar C to O ratios (e.g., solar C/O falls in the 1σ conﬁdence intervals in eight of the nine planets in our sample). Furthermore, within our sample we ﬁnd little evidence for thermal inversions over a wide range of effective temperatures (with the exception of HD 209458b), consistent with previous investigations. The lack of evidence for inversions for most planets in our sample over such a wide range of effective temperatures provides additional support for the hypothesis that TiO is unlikely to be the absorber responsible for the formation of these inversions.},

We have analyzed six photometric light curves of WASP-8b during secondary eclipse observed in the 3.6, 4.5, and 8.0 μm Infrared Array Camera bands. The eclipse depths are 0.113\% ± 0.018\%, 0.069\% ± 0.007\%, and 0.093\% ± 0.023\%, respectively, giving respective brightness temperatures of 1552, 1131, and 938 K. We characterized the atmospheric thermal proﬁle and composition of the planet using a line-by-line radiative transfer code and a Markov-chain Monte Carlo sampler. The data indicated no thermal inversion, independently of any assumption about chemical composition. We noted an anomalously high 3.6 μm brightness temperature (1552 K); by modeling the eccentricity-caused thermal variation, we found that this temperature is plausible for radiative timescales less than ∼102 hr. However, as no model spectra ﬁt all three data points well, the temperature discrepancy remains as an open question.},

Comparing the phase curves to the predictions of one-dimensional and threedimensional atmospheric models, we ﬁnd that WASP-19b’s dayside emission is consistent with a model atmosphere with no dayside thermal inversion and moderately efﬁcient day–night circulation. We also detect an eastward-shifted hotspot, which suggests the presence of a superrotating equatorial jet. In contrast, HAT-P-7b’s dayside emission suggests a dayside thermal inversion and relatively inefﬁcient day–night circulation; no hotspot shift is detected. For both planets, these same models do not agree with the measured nightside emission. The discrepancies in the model-data comparisons for WASP-19b might be explained by high-altitude silicate clouds on the nightside and/or high atmospheric metallicity, while the very low 3.6 μm nightside planetary brightness for HAT-P-7b may be indicative of an enhanced global C/O ratio.

Silicate and iron clouds are believed to disappear at the photosphere at the L/T transition, but cloudless models fail to reproduce correctly the spectra of T dwarfs, advocating for the addition of more physics, e.g., other types of clouds or internal energy transport mechanisms. We use a one-dimensional radiative/convective equilibrium code ATMO to investigate this issue. This code includes both equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium chemistry and solves consistently the PT structure. Included opacity sources are H2-H2, H2-He, H2O, CO, CO2, CH4, NH3, K, Na, and TiO, VO if they are present in the atmosphere. We show that the spectra of Y dwarfs can be accurately reproduced with a cloudless model if vertical mixing and NH3 quenching are taken into account. T dwarf spectra still have some reddening in, e.g., J–H, compared to cloudless models. This reddening can be reproduced by slightly reducing the temperature gradient in the atmosphere. We propose that this reduction of the stabilizing temperature gradient in these layers, leading to cooler structures, is due to the onset of ﬁngering convection, triggered by the destabilizing impact of condensation of very thin dust.},

	abstract = {The admitted, conventional scenario to explain the complex spectral evolution of brown dwarfs (BDs) since their ﬁrst detection20 years agohas always been the key role played by micron-size condensates, called “dust” or “clouds,” in their atmosphere. This scenario, however, faces major problems, in particular the J-band brightening and the resurgence of FeH absorption at the L to T transition, and a physical ﬁrst-principle understanding of this transition is lacking. In this Letter, we propose a new, completely different explanation for BD and extrasolar giant planet (EGP) spectral evolution, without the need to invoke clouds. We show that, due to the slowness of the CO/ CH4 and N2/NH3 chemical reactions, brown dwarf (L and T, respectively) and EGP atmospheres are subject to a thermo-chemical instability similar in nature to the ﬁngering or chemical convective instability present in Earth oceans and at the Earth core/mantle boundary. The induced small-scale turbulent energy transport reduces the temperature gradient in the atmosphere, explaining the observed increase in near-infrared J–H and J–K colors of L dwarfs and hot EGPs, while a warming up of the deep atmosphere along the L to T transition, as the CO/CH4 instability vanishes, naturally solves the two aforementioned puzzles, and provides a physical explanation of the L to T transition. This new picture leads to a drastic revision of our understanding of BD and EGP atmospheres and their evolution.},

	abstract = {Previous measurements of heat redistribution efﬁciency (the ability to transport energy from a planet’s highly irradiated dayside to its eternally dark nightside) show considerable variation between exoplanets. Theoretical models predict a positive correlation between heat redistribution efﬁciency and temperature for tidally locked planets; however, recent Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WASP-43b spectroscopic phase curve results are inconsistent with current predictions. Using the Spitzer Space Telescope, we obtained a total of three phase curve observations of WASP-43b (P=0.813 days) at 3.6 and 4.5μm. The ﬁrst 3.6μm visit exhibits spurious nightside emission that requires invoking unphysical conditions in our cloud-free atmospheric retrievals. The two other visits exhibit strong day–night contrasts that are consistent with the HST data. To reconcile the departure from theoretical predictions, WASP-43b would need to have a high-altitude, nightside cloud/haze layer blocking its thermal emission. Clouds/hazes could be produced within the planet’s cool, nearly retrograde mid-latitude ﬂows before dispersing across its nightside at high altitudes. Since mid-latitude ﬂows only materialize in fast-rotating (1 day) planets, this may explain an observed trend connecting measured day–night contrast with planet rotation rate that matches all current Spitzer phase curve results. Combining independent planetary emission measurements from multiple phases, we obtain a precise dayside hemisphere H2O abundance (2.5 ´ 10-5–1.1 ´ 10-4 at 1σ conﬁdence) and, assuming chemical equilibrium and a scaled solar abundance pattern, we derive a corresponding metallicity estimate that is consistent with being solar (0.4–1.7). Using the retrieved global CO+CO2 abundance under the same assumptions, we estimate a comparable metallicity of 0.3–1.7× solar. This is the ﬁrst time that precise abundance and metallicity constraints have been determined from multiple molecular tracers for a transiting exoplanet.},

However, recent work to further characterize its atmosphere and conﬁrm its composition has led to incompatible measurements and divergent conclusions. Additionally, the recent discovery of stellar binary companions ∼1′′ from WASP-12 further complicates the analyses and subsequent interpretations. We present a uniform analysis of all available Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescope secondary-eclipse data, including previously-unpublished Spitzer measurements at 3.6 and 4.5 µm. The primary controversy in the literature has centered on the value and interpretation of the eclipse depth at 4.5 µm. Our new measurements and analyses conﬁrm the shallow eclipse depth in this channel, as ﬁrst reported by Campo and collaborators and used by Madhusudhan and collaborators to infer a carbon-rich composition. To explain WASP-12b’s observed dayside emission spectrum, we implemented several recent retrieval approaches. We ﬁnd that when we exclude absorption due to C2H2 and HCN, which are not universally considered in the literature, our models require implausibly large atmospheric CO2 abundances, regardless of the C/O. By including C2H2 and HCN in our models, we ﬁnd that a physically-plausible carbon-rich solution achieves the best ﬁt to the available photometric and spectroscopic data. In comparison, the best-ﬁt oxygen-rich models have abundances that are inconsistent with the chemical equilibrium expectations for hydrogen-dominated atmospheres and are 670 times less probable. Our best-ﬁt solution is also 7.3×106 times more probable than an isothermal blackbody model.},

It is one of very few known short-period planets orbiting a hot A-type star, making it one of the hottest planets currently known. The availability of Kepler data allows us to measure the planet’s occultation (secondary eclipse) and phase curve in the optical, which we combine with occultations observed by warm Spitzer at 4.5 μm and 3.6 μm and a ground-based occultation observation in the Ks band (2.1 μm). We derive a day-side hemisphere temperature of 2750 ± 160 K as the effective temperature of a black body showing the same occultation depths. Comparing the occultation depths with one-dimensional planetary atmosphere models suggests the presence of an atmospheric temperature inversion. Our analysis shows evidence for a relatively high geometric albedo, Ag = 0.33+−00..0046. While measured with a simplistic method, a high Ag is supported also by the fact that the one-dimensional atmosphere models underestimate the occultation depth in the optical. We use stellar spectra to determine the dilution, in the four wide bands where occultation was measured, due to the visual stellar binary companion 1.15 ± 0.05 away. The revised stellar parameters measured using these spectra are combined with other measurements, leading to revised planetary mass and radius estimates of Mp = 4.94–8.09 MJ and Rp = 1.406 ± 0.038 RJ. Finally, we measure a Kepler midoccultation time that is 34.0 ± 6.9 s earlier than expected based on the midtransit time and the delay due to light-travel time and discuss possible scenarios.},

We study biosignature gases on exoplanets with thin H2 atmospheres and habitable surface temperatures, using a model atmosphere with photochemistry and a biomass estimate framework for evaluating the plausibility of a range of biosignature gas candidates. We ﬁnd that photochemically produced H atoms are the most abundant reactive species in H2 atmospheres. In atmospheres with high CO2 levels, atomic O is the major destructive species for some molecules. In Sun-Earth-like UV radiation environments, H (and in some cases O) will rapidly destroy nearly all biosignature gases of interest. The lower UV ﬂuxes from UV-quiet M stars would produce a lower concentration of H (or O) for the same scenario, enabling some biosignature gases to accumulate. The favorability of low-UV radiation environments to accumulate detectable biosignature gases in an H2 atmosphere is closely analogous to the case of oxidized atmospheres, where photochemically produced OH is the major destructive species. Most potential biosignature gases, such as dimethylsulﬁde and CH3Cl, are therefore more favorable in low-UV, as compared with solar-like UV, environments. A few promising biosignature gas candidates, including NH3 and N2O, are favorable even in solar-like UV environments, as these gases are destroyed directly by photolysis and not by H (or O). A more subtle ﬁnding is that most gases produced by life that are fully hydrogenated forms of an element, such as CH4 and H2S, are not effective signs of life in an H2-rich atmosphere because the dominant atmospheric chemistry will generate such gases abiologically, through photochemistry or geochemistry. Suitable biosignature gases in H2-rich atmospheres for super-Earth exoplanets transiting M stars could potentially be detected in transmission spectra with the James Webb Space Telescope.},

	abstract = {Over a large range of equilibrium temperatures, clouds shape the transmission spectrum of hot Jupiter atmospheres, yet their composition remains unknown. Recent observations show that the Kepler lightcurves of some hot Jupiters are asymmetric: for the hottest planets, the lightcurve peaks before secondary eclipse, whereas for planets cooler than ∼1900 K, it peaks after secondary eclipse. We use the thermal structure from 3D global circulation models to determine the expected cloud distribution and Kepler lightcurves of hot Jupiters. We demonstrate that the change from an optical lightcurve dominated by thermal emission to one dominated by scattering (reﬂection) naturally explains the observed trend from negative to positive offset. For the cool planets the presence of an asymmetry in the Kepler light curve is a telltale sign of the cloud composition, because each cloud species can produce an offset only over a narrow range of effective temperatures. By comparing our models and the observations, we show that the cloud composition of hot Jupiters likely varies with equilibrium temperature. We suggest that a transition occurs between silicate and manganese sulﬁde clouds at a temperature near 1600 K, analogous to the L/T transition on brown dwarfs. The cold trapping of cloud species below the photosphere naturally produces such a transition and predicts similar transitions for other condensates, including TiO. We predict that most hot Jupiters should have cloudy nightsides, that partial cloudiness should be common at the limb, and that the dayside hot spot should often be cloud-free.},

Recent observations suggest that some exoplanets, e.g., Wasp 12-b, have atmospheric C/O ratios substantially different from the solar value of 0.54. In this Letter, we present a mechanism that can produce such atmospheric deviations from the stellar C/O ratio. In protoplanetary disks, different snowlines of oxygen- and carbon-rich ices, especially water and carbon monoxide, will result in systematic variations in the C/O ratio both in the gas and in the condensed phases. In particular, between the H2O and CO snowlines most oxygen is present in icy grains—the building blocks of planetary cores in the core accretion model—while most carbon remains in the gas phase. This region is coincidental with the giant-planet-forming zone for a range of observed protoplanetary disks. Based on standard core accretion models of planet formation, gas giants that sweep up most of their atmospheres from disk gas outside of the water snowline will have a C/O ∼ 1, while atmospheres signiﬁcantly contaminated by evaporating planetesimals will have a stellar or substellar C/O when formed at the same disk radius. The overall metallicity will also depend on the atmosphere formation mechanism, and exoplanetary atmospheric compositions may therefore provide constraints on where and how a speciﬁc planet formed.},

	abstract = {Photoionization heating from ultraviolet (UV) radiation incidents on the atmospheres of hot Jupiters may drive planetary mass loss. Observations of stellar Lyman-α (Lyα) absorption have suggested that the hot Jupiter HD 209458b is losing atomic hydrogen. We construct a model of escape that includes realistic heating and cooling, ionization balance, tidal gravity, and pressure conﬁnement by the host star wind. We show that mass loss takes the form of a hydrodynamic (Parker) wind, emitted from the planet’s dayside during lulls in the stellar wind. When dayside winds are suppressed by the conﬁning action of the stellar wind, nightside winds might pick up if there is sufﬁcient horizontal transport of heat. A hot Jupiter loses mass at maximum rates of ∼2 × 1012 g s−1 during its host star’s pre-main-sequence phase and ∼2 × 1010 g s−1 during the star’s main-sequence lifetime, for total maximum losses of ∼0.06\% and ∼0.6\% of the planet’s mass, respectively. For UV ﬂuxes FUV 104 erg cm−2 s−1, the mass-loss rate is approximately energy limited and scales as M˙ ∝ FU0.V9. For larger UV ﬂuxes, such as those typical of T Tauri stars, radiative losses and plasma recombination force M˙ to increase more slowly as FU0.V6. Dayside winds are quenched during the T Tauri phase because of conﬁnement by overwhelming stellar wind pressure. During this early stage, nightside winds can still blow if the planet resides outside the stellar Alfve´n radius; otherwise, even nightside winds are stiﬂed by stellar magnetic pressure, and mass loss is restricted to polar regions. We conclude that while UV radiation can indeed drive winds from hot Jupiters, such winds cannot signiﬁcantly alter planetary masses during any evolutionary stage. They can, however, produce observable signatures. Candidates for explaining why the Lyman-α photons of HD 209458 are absorbed at Doppler-shifted velocities of ±100 km s−1 include charge-exchange in the shock between the planetary and stellar winds.},

One suggestion is that these observations indicate that the planet’s atmosphere is vertically compact, perhaps due to a water-rich composition that yields a large mean molecular weight. Another suggestion is that the atmosphere is hydrogen/helium-rich with clouds that obscure predicted absorption features. Previous models that incorporate clouds have included their effect without a strong physical motivation for their existence. Here, we present model atmospheres of GJ 1214b that include physically motivated clouds of two types. We model the clouds that are present in chemical equilibrium, as has been suggested to occur on brown dwarfs, which include KCl and ZnS for this planet. We also include clouds that form as a result of photochemistry, forming a hydrocarbon haze layer. We use a photochemical kinetics model to understand the vertical distribution and available mass of haze-forming molecules. We model both solar and enhanced-metallicity cloudy models and determine the cloud properties necessary to match observations. In enhanced-metallicity atmospheres, we ﬁnd that the equilibrium clouds can match the observations of GJ 1214b if they are lofted high into the atmosphere and have a low sedimentation efﬁciency (fsed = 0.1). We ﬁnd that models with a variety of hydrocarbon haze properties can match the observations. Particle sizes from 0.01 to 0.25 μm can match the transmission spectrum with haze-forming efﬁciencies as low as 1\%–5\%.},

This system consists of two confirmed transiting planets, Kepler-51b (P b = 45.2 days) and Kepler-51c (P c = 85.3 days), and one transiting planet candidate KOI-620.02 (P 02 = 130.2 days), which lie close to a 1: 2: 3 resonance chain. Our analysis shows that their TTVs are consistently explained by the three-planet model, and constrains their masses as (Kepler-51b), M c = 4.0 ± 0.4 M ⊕ (Kepler-51c), and M 02 = 7.6 ± 1.1 M ⊕ (KOI-620.02), thus confirming KOI-620.02 as a planet in this system. The masses inferred from the TTVs are rather small compared to the planetary radii based on the stellar density and planet-to-star radius ratios determined from the transit light curves. Combining these estimates, we find that all three planets in this system have densities among the lowest determined, ρ p ≲ 0.05 g cm–3. With this feature, the Kepler-51 system serves as another example of low-density compact multi-transiting planetary systems. We also identify a curious feature in the archived Kepler light curve during the double transit of Kepler-51b and KOI-620.02, which could be explained by their overlapping on the stellar disk (a planet-planet eclipse). If this is really the case, the sky-plane inclination of KOI-620.02's orbit relative to that of Kepler-51b is given by , implying significant misalignment of their orbital planes. This interpretation, however, seems unlikely because such an event that is consistent with all of the observations is found to be exceedingly rare.},

We used the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 (HST WFC3) with its G141 grism covering 1.1 μm to 1.7 μm and spatially scanned the image across the detector at 2 s−1. When smoothed to 75 nm bins, the local maxima of the transit depths in the 1.15 μm and 1.4 μm water vapor features are, respectively, 83 ± 53 ppm and 200 ± 47 ppm greater than the local minimum at 1.3 μm. We compare the WFC3 spectrum with the composite transit spectrum of HD 189733b assembled by Pont et al., extending from 0.3 μm to 24 μm. Although the water vapor features in the WFC3 spectrum are compatible with the model of non-absorbing, Rayleigh-scattering dust in the planetary atmosphere, we also re-interpret the available data with a clear planetary atmosphere. In the latter interpretation, the slope of increasing transit depth with shorter wavelengths from the near infrared, through the visible, and into the ultraviolet is caused by unocculted star spots, with a smaller contribution of Rayleigh scattering by molecular hydrogen in the planet’s atmosphere. At relevant pressures along the terminator, our model planetary atmosphere’s temperature is ∼700 K, which is below the condensation temperatures of sodium- and potassium-bearing molecules, causing the broad wings of the spectral lines of Na i and K i at 0.589 μm and 0.769 μm to be weak.},

We achieve almost photon-limited results for individual spectral bins, but the uncertainties in the transit depth for the band-integrated data are exacerbated by the uneven sampling of the light curve imposed by the orbital phasing of HST’s observations. Our ﬁnal transit spectra for all three objects are consistent with the presence of a broad absorption feature at 1.4 μm most likely due to water. However, the amplitude of the absorption is less than that expected based on previous observations with Spitzer, possibly due to hazes absorbing in the NIR or non-solar compositions. The degeneracy of models with different compositions and temperature structures combined with the low amplitude of any features in the data preclude our ability to place unambiguous constraints on the atmospheric composition without additional observations with WFC3 to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and/or a comprehensive multi-wavelength analysis.},

	abstract = {Until recently, infrared observations of exoplanetary atmospheres have typically been interpreted using models that assumed solar elemental abundances. With the chemical composition ﬁxed, attempts have been made to classify hot Jupiter atmospheres on the basis of stellar irradiation. However, recent observations have revealed deviations from predictions based on such classiﬁcation schemes, and chemical compositions retrieved from some data sets have also indicated non-solar abundances. The data require a two-dimensional (2D) characterization scheme with dependence on both irradiation and chemistry. In this work, we suggest the carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio as an important second dimension for characterizing exoplanetary atmospheres. In hot-hydrogen-dominated atmospheres, the C/O ratio critically inﬂuences the relative concentrations of several spectroscopically dominant species. Between a C/O of 0.5 (solar value) and 2, the H2O and CH4 abundances can vary by several orders of magnitude in the observable atmosphere, and new hydrocarbon species such as HCN and C2H2 become prominent for C/O 1, while the CO abundance remains almost unchanged. Furthermore, a C/O 1 can preclude a strong thermal inversion due to TiO and VO in a hot Jupiter atmosphere, since TiO and VO are naturally underabundant for C/O 1. We, therefore, suggest a new 2D classiﬁcation scheme for hydrogen-dominated exoplanetary atmospheres with irradiation (or temperature) and C/O ratio as the two dimensions. We deﬁne four classes in this 2D space (O1, O2, C1, and C2) with distinct chemical, thermal, and spectral properties. Based on the most recent observations, we characterize the thermal structure and C/O ratios of six hot Jupiters (XO-1b, CoRoT-2b, WASP-14b, WASP-19b, WASP-33b, and WASP-12b) in the framework of our proposed 2D classiﬁcation scheme. While the data for several systems in our sample are consistent with C-rich atmospheres, new observations are required to conclusively constrain their C/O ratios in the day side as well as the terminator regions of their atmospheres. We discuss how observations using existing and forthcoming facilities can constrain C/O ratios in exoplanetary atmospheres.},

We show that this puzzle is solved if super-Earths formed late, as the last vestiges of their parent gas disks were about to clear. This scenario would seem to present fine-tuning problems, but we show that there are none. Ambient gas densities can span many (in one case up to 9) orders of magnitude, and super-Earths can still robustly emerge after ∼0.1–1 Myr with percent-by-weight atmospheres. Super-Earth cores are naturally bred in gas-poor environments where gas dynamical friction has weakened sufficiently to allow constituent protocores to gravitationally stir one another and merge. So little gas is present at the time of core assembly that cores hardly migrate by disk torques: formation of super-Earths can be in situ. The basic picture—that close-in super-Earths form in a gas-poor (but not gas-empty) inner disk, fed continuously by gas that bleeds inward from a more massive outer disk—recalls the largely evacuated but still accreting inner cavities of transitional protoplanetary disks. We also address the inverse problem presented by super-puffs: an uncommon class of short-period planets seemingly too voluminous for their small masses (4–10R⊕, 2–6M⊕). Super-puffs most easily acquire their thick atmospheres as dust-free, rapidly cooling worlds outside ∼1 AU where nebular gas is colder, less dense, and therefore less opaque. Unlike super-Earths, which can form in situ, super-puffs probably migrated in to their current orbits; they are expected to form the outer links of mean-motion resonant chains, and to exhibit greater water content. We close by confronting observations and itemizing remaining questions.},

For example, past observations of the dayside emission spectrum of the hot Jupiter WASP-12b indicated that its atmosphere has a high carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O {\textgreater} 1), suggesting it had a different formation pathway than is commonly assumed for giant planets. Here we report a precise nearinfrared transmission spectrum for WASP-12b based on six transit observations with the Hubble Space Telescope/ Wide Field Camera 3. We bin the data in 13 spectrophotometric light curves from 0.84 to 1.67 μm and measure the transit depths to a median precision of 51 ppm. We retrieve the atmospheric properties using the transmission spectrum and ﬁnd strong evidence for water absorption (7σ conﬁdence). This detection marks the ﬁrst highconﬁdence, spectroscopic identiﬁcation of a molecule in the atmosphere of WASP-12b. The retrieved 1 σ water volume mixing ratio is between 10−5 and 10−2, which is consistent with C/O {\textgreater} 1 to within 2σ. However, we also introduce a new retrieval parameterization that ﬁts for C/O and metallicity under the assumption of chemical equilibrium. With this approach, we constrain C/O to 0.5-+00..32 at 1σ and rule out a carbon-rich atmosphere composition (C/O {\textgreater} 1) at {\textgreater}3σ conﬁdence. Further observations and modeling of the planet’s global thermal structure and dynamics would aid in resolving the tension between our inferred C/O and previous constraints.

	abstract = {We present high resolution transmission spectra of giant planet atmospheres from a coupled three-dimensional (3D) atmospheric dynamics and transmission spectrum model that includes Doppler shifts which arise from winds and planetary motion. We model Jovian planets covering more than two orders of magnitude in incident flux, corresponding to planets with 0.9-55 day orbital periods around solar-type stars. The results of our 3D dynamical models reveal certain aspects of high resolution transmission spectra that are not present in simple one-dimensional (1D) models. We find that the hottest planets experience strong substellar to anti-stellar (SSAS) winds, resulting in transmission spectra with net blueshifts of up to 3 km s–1, whereas less irradiated planets show almost no net Doppler shifts. We find only minor differences between transmission spectra for atmospheres with temperature inversions and those without. Compared to 1D models, peak line strengths are significantly reduced for the hottest atmospheres owing to Doppler broadening from a combination of rotation (which is faster for close-in planets under the assumption of tidal locking) and atmospheric winds. Finally, high resolution transmission spectra may be useful in studying the atmospheres of exoplanets with optically thick clouds since line cores for very strong transitions should remain optically thick to very high altitude. High resolution transmission spectra are an excellent observational test for the validity of 3D atmospheric dynamics models, because they provide a direct probe of wind structures and heat circulation. Ground-based exoplanet spectroscopy is currently on the verge of being able to verify some of our modeling predictions, most notably the dependence of SSAS winds on insolation. We caution that interpretation of high resolution transmission spectra based on 1D atmospheric models may be inadequate, as 3D atmospheric motions can produce a noticeable effect on the absorption signatures.},

First, we show that our model “grid” recovers trends shown in traditional parametric studies of hot Jupiters, particularly equatorial superrotation and increased day–night temperature contrast with increasing equilibrium temperature. We show how spatial temperature variations, particularly between the dayside and nightside and west and east terminators, can vary by hundreds of kelvin, which could imply large variations in Na, K, CO and CH4 abundances in those regions. These chemical variations can be large enough to be observed in transmission with high-resolution spectrographs, such as ESPRESSO on VLT, METIS on the E-ELT, orMIRI and NIRSpec aboard JWST. We also compare theoretical emission spectra generated from our models toavailable Spitzer eclipse depths for each planetand ﬁnd that the outputs from our solar-metallicity, cloud-free models generally provide a good match to many of the datasets, even without additional model tuning. Although these models are cloud-free, we can use their results to understand the chemistry and dynamics that drive cloud formation in their atmospheres.},

WASP-74b orbits a star of V = 9.7, making it one of the brighter systems accessible to southern telescopes. It is a 0.95MJup planet with a moderately bloated radius of 1.5 RJup in a 2 day orbit around a slightly evolved F9 star. WASP-83b is a Saturn-mass planet at 0.3 MJup with a radius of 1.0 RJup. It is in a 5 day orbit around a fainter (V = 12.9) G8 star. WASP-89b is a 6 MJup planet in a 3 day orbit with an eccentricity of e = 0.2. It is thus similar to massive, eccentric planets such as XO-3b and HAT-P-2b, except that those planets orbit F stars whereas WASP-89 is a K star. The V = 13.1 host star is magnetically active, showing a rotation period of 20.2 days, while star spots are visible in the transits. There are indications that the planet’s orbit is aligned with the stellar spin. WASP-89 is a good target for an extensive study of transits of star spots.},

	abstract = {Most exoplanets detected by direct imaging thus far have been characterized by relatively hot ( 1000 K) and cloudy atmospheres. A surprising feature in some of their atmospheres has been a distinct lack of methane, possibly implying non-equilibrium chemistry. Recently, we reported the discovery of a planetary companion to the Sun-like star GJ 504 using Subaru/HiCIAO within the Strategic Exploration of Exoplanets and Disks with Subaru survey. The planet is substantially colder ({\textless}600 K) than previously imaged planets, and has indications of fewer clouds, which implies that it represents a new class of planetary atmospheres with expected similarities to late T-type brown dwarfs in the same temperature range. If so, one might also expect the presence of signiﬁcant methane absorption, which is characteristic of such objects. Here, we report the detection of deep methane absorption in the atmosphere of GJ 504 b, using the Spectral Differential Imaging mode of HiCIAO to distinguish the absorption features around 1.6 μm. We also report updated JHK photometry based on new Ks-band data and a re-analysis of the existing data. The results support the notion that GJ 504 b has atmospheric properties distinct from other imaged exoplanets, and will become a useful reference object for future planets in the same temperature range.},

We have re-analyzed an existing 4.5 μm data set, consisting of 10 observations of the XO-3b system during secondary eclipse, using seven different techniques for removing correlated noise. We ﬁnd that, on average, for a given technique, the eclipse depth estimate is repeatable from epoch to epoch to within 156 parts per million (ppm). Most techniques derive eclipse depths that do not vary by more than a factor 3 of the photon noise limit. All methods but one accurately assess their own errors: for these methods, the individual measurement uncertainties are comparable to the scatter in eclipse depths over the 10 epoch sample. To assess the accuracy of the techniques as well as to clarify the difference between instrumental and other sources of measurement error, we have also analyzed a simulated data set of 10 visits to XO-3b, for which the eclipse depth is known. We ﬁnd that three of the methods (BLISS mapping, Pixel Level Decorrelation, and Independent Component Analysis) obtain results that are within three times the photon limit of the true eclipse depth. When averaged over the 10 epoch ensemble, 5 out of 7 techniques come within 60 ppm of the true value. Spitzer exoplanet data, if obtained following current best practices and reduced using methods such as those described here, can measure repeatable and accurate single eclipse depths, with close to photon-limited results.},

The sample was extracted from the Hipparcos catalog and consists of 114 stars with colors and absolute magnitudes within the range of known γ Doradus stars and that also lie within a speciﬁed volume of 266,600 pc3. We devoted one year of observing time with our T12 0.8 m automatic photometric telescope to acquire nightly observations of the complete sample of stars. From these survey observations, we identify 37 stars with intrinsic variability of 0.002 mag or more. Of these 37 variables, 8 have already been conﬁrmed as γ Doradus stars in our earlier papers; we scheduled the remaining 29 variables on our T3 0.4 m automatic telescope to acquire more intensive observations over the next two years. As promising new γ Doradus candidates were identiﬁed from the photometry, we obtained complementary spectroscopic observations of each candidate with the Kitt Peak coude´ feed telescope. Analysis of our new photometric and spectroscopic data reveals 15 new γ Doradus variables (and conﬁrms two others), 8 new δ Scuti variables (and conﬁrms one other), and 3 new variables with unresolved periodicity. Therefore, of the 114 γ Doradus candidates in our volume-limited sample, we ﬁnd 25 stars that are new or previously known γ Doradus variables. This results in an incidence of 22\% for γ Doradus variability among candidate ﬁeld stars for this volume of the solar neighborhood. The corresponding space density of γ Doradus stars in this volume of space is 0.094 stars per 103 pc3 or 94 stars per 106 pc3. We provide an updated list of 86 bright, conﬁrmed, γ Doradus ﬁeld stars.},

We observed in spatial scan mode to decrease instrument systematic effects in the data, and removed ﬂuctuations in the data due to stellar pulsations. The rms for our ﬁnal, binned spectrum is 1.05 times the photon noise. We compare our ﬁnal spectrum, along with previously published photometric data, to atmospheric models of WASP-33b spanning a wide range in temperature proﬁles and chemical compositions. We ﬁnd that the data require models with an oxygen-rich chemical composition and a temperature proﬁle that increases at high altitude. We ﬁnd that our measured spectrum displays an excess in the measured ﬂux toward short wavelengths that is best explained as emission from TiO. If conﬁrmed by additional measurements at shorter wavelengths, this planet would become the ﬁrst hot Jupiter with a thermal inversion that can be deﬁnitively attributed to the presence of TiO in its dayside atmosphere.},

Signiﬁcantly deeper transits are measured in these optical bandpasses relative to the near-infrared wavelengths. We conclude that scattering by high-altitude haze alone is unlikely to account for this difference and instead interpret it as evidence for titanium oxide and vanadium oxide absorption. Enhanced opacity is also inferred across the 1.12–1.3 μm wavelength range, possibly due to iron hydride absorption. If conﬁrmed, WASP-121b will be the ﬁrst exoplanet with titanium oxide, vanadium oxide, and iron hydride detected in transmission.

These observations cover broadbands at 0.59–0.72 and 0.39–0.5 μm, and narrowbands at 0.938 (atmospheric window), 0.889 (CH4 absorption band), and 0.24–0.28 μm.

For Jupiter, we also ﬁt the modeled light curves to the observed full-disk brightness. We derive spherical albedos for Jupiter andSaturn, and for planets with Lambertian and Rayleigh-scattering atmospheres. Jupiter-like atmospheres can produce light curves that are a factor of two fainter at half-phase than the Lambertian planet, given the same geometric albedo at transit. The spherical albedo is typically lower than for a Lambertian planet by up to a factor of ∼1.5. The Lambertian assumption will underestimate the absorption of the stellar light and the equilibrium temperature of the planetary atmosphere. We also compare our light curves with the light curves of solid bodies: the moons Enceladus and Callisto. Their strong backscattering peak within a few degrees of opposition (secondary eclipse) can lead to an even stronger underestimate of the stellar heating.},

The resulting planetary emission spectrum is well approximated by a blackbody, and consequently our primary conclusion is that the planet’s infrared photosphere is nearly isothermal.

However, only a handful of hot Jupiters have been observed with high enough photometric precision at visible wavelengths to investigate these expectations. The NASA Kepler mission provides a means to widen the sample and to assess the extent to which hot Jupiter albedos are low. We present a global analysis of Kepler-7 b based on Q0–Q4 data, published radial velocities, and asteroseismology constraints. We measure an occultation depth in the Kepler bandpass of 44 ± 5 ppm. If directly related to the albedo, this translates to a Kepler geometric albedo of 0.32 ± 0.03, the most precise value measured so far for an exoplanet. We also characterize the planetary orbital phase light curve with an amplitude of 42 ± 4 ppm. Using atmospheric models, we ﬁnd it unlikely that the high albedo is due to a dominant thermal component and propose two solutions to explain the observed planetary ﬂux. First, we interpret the Kepler-7 b albedo as resulting from an excess reﬂection over what can be explained solely by Rayleigh scattering, along with a nominal thermal component. This excess reﬂection might indicate the presence of a cloud or haze layer in the atmosphere, motivating new modeling and observational efforts. Alternatively, the albedo can be explained by Rayleigh scattering alone if Na and K are depleted in the atmosphere by a factor of 10–100 below solar abundances.},

We then use a simple model-independent technique to estimate a planet’s effective temperature from planet/star ﬂux ratios. We use thermal secondary eclipse measurements—those obtained at λ {\textgreater} 0.8 μm—to estimate day-side effective temperatures, Td, and thermal phase variations—when available—to estimate night-side effective temperature. We strongly rule out the “null hypothesis” of a single AB and ε for all 24 planets. If we allow each planet to have different parameters, we ﬁnd that low Bond albedos are favored (AB {\textless} 0.35 at 1σ conﬁdence), which is an independent conﬁrmation of the low albedos inferred from nondetections of reﬂected light. Our sample exhibits a wide variety of redistribution efﬁciencies. When normalized by T0, the day-side effective temperatures of the 24 planets describe a uni-modal distribution. The two biggest outliers are GJ 436b (abnormally hot) and HD 80606b (abnormally cool), and these are the only eccentric planets in our sample. The dimensionless quantity Td/T0 exhibits no trend with the presence or absence of stratospheric inversions. There is also no clear trend between Td/T0 and T0. That said, the six planets with the greatest sub-stellar equilibrium temperatures (T {\textgreater} 2400 K) have low ε, as opposed to the 18 cooler planets, which show a variety of recirculation efﬁciencies. This hints that the very hottest transiting giant planets are qualitatively different from the merely hot Jupiters. We propose an explanation of this trend based on how a planet’s radiative and advective times scale with temperature: both timescales are expected to be shorter for hotter planets, but the temperature dependence of the radiative timescale is stronger, leading to decreased heat recirculation efﬁciency.},

	abstract = {We observed two secondary eclipses of the exoplanet WASP-12b using the Infrared Array Camera on the Spitzer Space Telescope. The close proximity of WASP-12b to its G-type star results in extreme tidal forces capable of inducing apsidal precession with a period as short as a few decades. This precession would be measurable if the orbit had a signiﬁcant eccentricity, leading to an estimate of the tidal Love number and an assessment of the degree of central concentration in the planetary interior. An initial ground-based secondary-eclipse phase reported by Lo´pez-Morales et al. (0.510 ± 0.002) implied eccentricity at the 4.5σ level. The spectroscopic orbit of Hebb et al. has eccentricity 0.049 ± 0.015, a 3σ result, implying an eclipse phase of 0.509 ± 0.007. However, there is a well-documented tendency of spectroscopic data to overestimate small eccentricities. Our eclipse phases are 0.5010 ± 0.0006 (3.6 and 5.8 μm) and 0.5006 ± 0.0007 (4.5 and 8.0 μm). An unlikely orbital precession scenario invoking an alignment of the orbit during the Spitzer observations could have explained this apparent discrepancy, but the ﬁnal eclipse phase of Lo´pez-Morales et al. (0.510 ±+−00..000076) is consistent with a circular orbit at better than 2σ . An orbit ﬁt to all the available transit, eclipse, and radial-velocity data indicates precession at {\textless} 1σ ; a non-precessing solution ﬁts better. We also comment on analysis and reporting for Spitzer exoplanet data in light of recent re-analyses.},

	abstract = {Planetary systems are thought to be born in protoplanetary disks. Isotope ratios are a powerful tool for investigating the material origin and evolution from molecular clouds to planetary systems via protoplanetary disks. However, it is challenging to measure the isotope (isotopologue) ratios, especially in protoplanetary disks, because the emission lines of major species are saturated. We developed a new method to overcome these challenges by using optically thin line wings induced by thermal broadening. As a ﬁrst application of the method, we analyzed two carbon monoxide isotopologue lines, 12CO 3–2 and 13CO 3–2, from archival observations of a protoplanetary disk around TW Hya with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The 12CO/13CO ratio was estimated to be 21 ± 5 at disk radii of 70–110 au, which is signiﬁcantly smaller than the value observed in the local interstellar medium, ∼69. It implies that an isotope exchange reaction occurs in a low-temperature environment with C/ O {\textgreater} 1. In contrast, it is suggested that 12CO/13CO is higher than ∼84 in the outer disk (r {\textgreater} 130 au), which can be explained by the difference in the binding energy of the isotopologues on dust grains and the CO gas depletion processes. Our results imply that the gas-phase 12CO/13CO can vary by a factor of {\textgreater}4 even inside a protoplanetary disk and therefore can be used to trace material evolution in disks.},

	abstract = {HST/WFC3's spatial scan monitor automatically reduces and analyzes time-series data taken in spatial scan mode with the IR grisms. Here we describe the spatial scan monitor pipeline and present results derived from eight years of transiting exoplanet data. Our goal is to monitor the quality of the data and make recommendations to users that will enhance future observations. We find that a typical observation achieves a white light curve precision that is \$1.07{\textbackslash}times\$ the photon-limit (which is slightly better than expectations) and that the pointing drift is relatively stable during times of normal telescope operations. We note that observations cannot achieve the optimal precision when the drift along the dispersion direction (\$X\$ axis) exceeds 15 mas (\${\textbackslash}sim\$0.11 pixels). Based on our sample, 77.1\% of observations are ''successful'' (\${\textless}15\$ mas rms drift), 12.0\% are ''marginal'' (15 -- 135 mas), and 10.8\% of observations have ''failed'' (\${\textgreater}135\$ mas or \${\textgreater}1\$ pixel), meaning they do not achieve the necessary pointing stability to achieve the optimal spectroscopic precision. In comparing the observed versus calculated maximum pixel fluence, we find that the J band is a better predictor of fluence than the H band. Using this information, we derive an updated, empirical relation for scan rate that also accounts for the J-H color of the host star. We implement this relation and other improvements in version 1.4 of PandExo and version 0.5 of ExoCTK. Finally, we make recommendations on how to plan future observations with increased precision.},

	abstract = {The large radii of many hot Jupiters can only be matched by models that have hot interior adiabats, and recent theoretical work has shown that the interior evolution of hot Jupiters has a signiﬁcant impact on their atmospheric structure. Due to its inﬂated radius, low gravity, and ultrahot equilibrium temperature, WASP-76b is an ideal case study for the impact of internal evolution on observable properties. Hot interiors should most strongly affect the nonirradiated side of the planet, and thus full phase-curve observations are critical to ascertain the effect of the interior on the atmospheres of hot Jupiters. In this work, we present the ﬁrst Spitzer phase-curve observations of WASP-76b. We ﬁnd that WASP-76b has an ultrahot dayside and relatively cold nightside with brightness temperatures of 2471 ± 27 K/1518 ± 61 K at 3.6 μm and 2699 ± 32 K/1259 ± 44 K at 4.5 μm, respectively. These results provide evidence for a dayside thermal inversion. Both channels exhibit small phase offsets of 0.68 ± 0°. 48 at 3.6 μm and 0.67 ± 0°. 2 at 4.5 μm. We compare our observations to a suite of general circulation models (GCMs) that consider two endmembers of interior temperature along with a broad range of frictional drag strengths. Strong frictional drag is necessary to match the small phase offsets and cold nightside temperatures observed. From our suite of cloud-free GCMs, we ﬁnd that only cases with a cold interior can reproduce the cold nightsides and large phase-curve amplitude at 4.5 μm, hinting that the hot interior adiabat of WASP-76b does not signiﬁcantly impact its atmospheric dynamics or that clouds blanket its nightside.},

We model the star simultaneously in the fit and provide several state-of-the-art ways to constrain its properties, including taking advantage of the now-ubiquitous all-sky catalog photometry and Gaia parallaxes. EXOFASTv2 can model the star by itself, too. Multi-planet systems are modeled self-consistently with the same underlying stellar mass that defines their semi-major axes through Kepler's law and the planetary period. Transit timing, duration, and depth variations can be modeled with a simple command line option. We explain our methodology and rationale as well as provide an improved version of the core transit model that is both 25{\textbackslash}\% faster and more accurate. We highlight several potential pitfalls in exoplanet modeling, including the handling of eccentricity in transit-only fits, that the standard exoplanet convention for \${\textbackslash}omega\$ uses a left-handed coordinate system, contrary to most modern textbooks, how to avoid an important degeneracy when allowing negative companion masses, and a widely unappreciated, potential 10-minute ambiguity in the reported transit times. EXOFASTv2 is available at https://github.com/jdeast/EXOFASTv2 . The code is written in IDL, and includes an executable that can be run freely and legally without an IDL license or any knowledge of the language. Extensive documentation and tutorials are included in the distribution for a variety of example fits. Advanced amateurs and undergrads have successfully performed sophisticated global fits of complex planetary systems with EXOFASTv2.

Nevertheless, Spitzer was the first facility to detect thermal emission from a hot Jupiter-sized planet, and the range of its exoplanetary investigations grew to encompass transiting planets, microlensing, brown dwarfs, and direct imaging searches and astrometry. Spitzer used phase curves to measure the longitudinal distribution of heat as well as time-dependent heating on hot Jupiters. Its secondary eclipse observations strongly constrained the dayside thermal emission spectra and corresponding atmospheric compositions of hot Jupiters, and the timings of eclipses were used for studies of orbital dynamics. Spitzer’s sensitivity to carbon-based molecules such as methane and carbon monoxide was key to atmospheric composition studies of transiting exoplanets as well as imaging spectroscopy of brown dwarfs, and complemented Hubble Space Telescope spectroscopy at shorter wavelengths. Its capability for long continuous observing sequences enabled searches for new transiting planets around cool stars and helped to define the architectures of planetary systems such as TRAPPIST-1. Spitzer measured masses for small planets at large orbital distances using microlensing parallax. Spitzer observations of brown dwarfs probed their temperatures, masses and weather patterns. Imaging and astrometry from Spitzer was used to discover new planetary-mass brown dwarfs and to measure distances and space densities of many others.},

Conclusions. Although only one super-Jupiter and one brown dwarf now have a measured 12CO/13CO ratio, it is intriguing that they are different, possibly hinting to distinct formation pathways. Regardless of spectroscopic similarities, isolated brown dwarfs may experience a top-down formation via gravitational collapse, which resembles star formation, while giant exoplanets favourably form through core accretion, which potentially alters isotopologue ratios in their atmospheres depending on the material they accrete from protoplanetary disks. This further emphasises atmospheric carbon isotopologue ratio as a tracer of the formation history of exoplanets. In the future, analyses such as those presented here should be conducted on a wide range of exoplanets using medium-to-high-resolution spectroscopy to further assess planet formation processes.},

On the other hand, Q for the major planets is always larger than 6 × 104. Estimates of tidal dissipation in the atmospheres of the Jovian planets lead to values of Q which are consistent with those we have calculated on the basis of secular changes in the satellites' orbits. However, it is difficult to reconcile these large Q's with the much smaller values obtained in laboratory tests of solids. Lyttleton's hypothesis that Pluto is an escaped satellite of Neptune is critically examined. Using the Q's we obtain for the major planets and their satellites, we show that any eccentricity that Triton's orbit may have possessed after a near encounter with Pluto would have been subsequently damped, thus accounting for its present near-circular orbit.},

Including the effects of the severe stellar insolation implied, we extend the theory of giant planets we have recently developed to encompass those at very small orbital distances. Our calculations can be used to help formulate search strategies for luminous planets in tight orbits around other nearby stars. We calculate the radii and luminosities of such giant planets for a variety of compositions (H/He, He, H2O, and olivine), the evolutionary tracks for solar-composition gas giants, and the geometry of the Hayashi forbidden zone in the gas-giant mass regime. We show that such planets are stable and estimate the magnitude of classical Jeans evaporation and of photodissociation and loss due to EUV radiation. In addition, we demonstrate that for the mass range quoted, such planets are well within their Roche lobes. We show that the strong composition dependence of the model radii and the distinctive spectral signatures provide clear diagnostics that might reveal 51 Peg B’s nature, should interferometric or adaptive-optics techniques ever succeed in photometrically separating planet from star.},

	abstract = {▪ Abstract  Giant planets have now been discovered around other stars, and it is only a matter of time until Earth-sized planets are detected. Whether any of these planets are suitable for life depends on their volatile abundances, especially water, and on their climates. Only planets within the liquid-water habitable zone (HZ) can support life on their surfaces and, thus, can be analyzed remotely to determine whether they are inhabited. Fortunately, current models predict that HZs are relatively wide around main-sequence stars not too different from our sun. This conclusion is based on studies of how our own planet has evolved over time. Earth's climate has remained conducive to life for the past 3.5 billion years or more, despite a large increase in solar luminosity, probably because of previous higher concentrations of CO

Astronomy provides the context for the origin and evolution of life on Earth. Conversely, discoveries about the terrestrial biosphere—from extremophilic microbes to the evolution of intelligence— inform our thinking about prospects for life elsewhere. Astrobiology includes the search for extraterrestrial life via in situ exploration, spectroscopy of solar and extrasolar plan-etary atmospheres, and the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. This review situates astrobiology within philosophical issues of the definition of life and the biological compatibility of the universe. It reviews the habitability of the Galaxy in general and of planets and moons in particular, and summarizes current controversies in origins-of-life research and in evidence for the earliest life on Earth. It critiques certain 'rare Earth' and 'anthropic' arguments, and considers four approaches to deciding whether intelligent life exists elsewhere in the Galaxy. It concludes that astrobiology must also speak to the future of human civilization.},

Next, we examine our current understanding of the evolutionary history and current interior structure of the planets, where we focus on bulk composition as well as viable models to explain the inflated radii of the population. Finally, we discuss aspects of their atmospheres in the context of observations and 1D and 3D models, including atmospheric structure and escape, spectroscopic signatures, and complex atmospheric circulation. The major opacity sources in these atmospheres, including alkali metals, water vapor, and others, are discussed. We discuss physics that control the 3D atmospheric circulation and day-to-night temperature structures. We conclude by suggesting important future work for still-open questions.},

Here we present spectroscopic evidence for a probable brown-dwarf companion to the solar-type star HD114762. This star undergoes periodic variations in radial velocity which we attribute to orbital motion resulting from the presence of an unseen companion. The rather short period of 84 days places the companion in an orbit similar to that of Mercury around the Sun, whereas the rather low velocity amplitude of about 0.6 km s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} implies that the mass of the companion may be as low as 0.011 solar masses, or 11 Jupiter masses. This leads to the suggestion that the companion is probably a brown dwarf, and may even be a giant planet. However, because the inclination of the orbit to the line of sight is unknown, the mass of the companion may be considerably larger than this lower limit.},

HAT-P-41b is an ideal target that sits in the transitioning parameter space between hot and ultra-hot Jupiters, and future James Webb Space Telescope observations will help us to better constrain the thermal structure and chemical composition.},

	abstract = {The atmospheres of ultra-hot Jupiters have been characterized in detail through recent phase curve and low- and high-resolution emission and transmission spectroscopic observations. Previous numerical studies have analyzed the effect of the localized recombination of hydrogen on the atmospheric dynamics and heat transport of ultra-hot Jupiters, finding that hydrogen dissociation and recombination lead to a reduction in the day-to-night contrasts of ultra-hot Jupiters relative to previous expectations. In this work, we add to previous efforts by also considering the localized condensation of clouds in the atmospheres of ultra-hot Jupiters, their resulting transport by the atmospheric circulation, and the radiative feedback of clouds on the atmospheric dynamics. To do so, we include radiatively active cloud tracers into the existing MITgcm framework for simulating the atmospheric dynamics of ultra-hot Jupiters. We take cloud condensate properties appropriate for the high-temperature condensate corundum from CARMA cloud microphysics models. We conduct a suite of GCM simulations with varying cloud microphysical and radiative properties, and we find that partial cloud coverage is a ubiquitous outcome of our simulations. This patchy cloud distribution is inherently set by atmospheric dynamics in addition to equilibrium cloud condensation, and causes a cloud greenhouse effect that warms the atmosphere below the cloud deck. Nightside clouds are further sequestered at depth due to a dynamically induced high-altitude thermal inversion. We post-process our GCMs with the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code gCMCRT and find that the patchy clouds on ultra-hot Jupiters do not significantly impact transmission spectra but can affect their phase-dependent emission spectra.},

This has been taken as evidence that comets contributed a relatively small fraction of the terrestrial water. We present new sensitive spectroscopic observations of water isotopologues in the Jupiterfamily comet 46P/Wirtanen carried out using the GREAT spectrometer aboard the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA). The derived D/H ratio of (1.61 ± 0.65) × 10−4 is the same as in the Earth’s oceans. Although the statistics are limited, we show that interesting trends are already becoming apparent in the existing data. A clear anti-correlation is seen between the D/H ratio and the active fraction, deﬁned as the ratio of the active surface area to the total nucleus surface. Comets with an active fraction above 0.5 typically have D/H ratios in water consistent with the terrestrial value. These hyperactive comets, such as 46P/Wirtanen, require an additional source of water vapor in their coma, explained by the presence of subliming icy grains expelled from the nucleus. The observed correlation may suggest that hyperactive comets belong to a population of ice-rich objects that formed just outside the snow line, or in the outermost regions of the solar nebula, from water thermally reprocessed in the inner disk that was transported outward during the early disk evolution. The observed anti-correlation between the active fraction and the nucleus size seems to argue against the ﬁrst interpretation, as planetesimals near the snow line are expected to undergo rapid growth. Alternatively, isotopic properties of water outgassed from the nucleus and icy grains may be diﬀerent due to fractionation eﬀects at sublimation. In this case, all comets may share the same Earth-like D/H ratio in water, with profound implications for the early solar system and the origin of Earth’s oceans.},

Yet, only a handful of rocky exoplanet atmospheres are suitable for observation with planned next-generation telescopes. To broaden prospects, we describe the possibilities for an aerial, liquid water cloud-based biosphere in the atmospheres of sub Neptune-sized temperate exoplanets, those receiving Earth-like irradiation from their host stars. One such planet is known (K2-18b) and other candidates are being followed up. Sub Neptunes are common and easier to study observationally than rocky exoplanets because of their larger sizes, lower densities, and extended atmospheres or envelopes. Yet, sub Neptunes lack any solid surface as we know it, so it is worthwhile considering whether their atmospheres can support an aerial biosphere. We review, synthesize, and build upon existing research. Passive microbial-like life particles must persist aloft in a region with liquid water clouds for long enough to metabolize, reproduce, and spread before downward transport to lower altitudes that may be too hot for life of any kind to survive. Dynamical studies are needed to flesh out quantitative details of life particle residence times. A sub Neptune would need to be a part of a planetary system with an unstable asteroid belt in order for meteoritic material to provide nutrients, though life would also need to efficiently reuse and recycle metals. The origin of life may be the most severe limiting challenge. Regardless of the uncertainties, we can keep an open mind to the search for biosignature gases as a part of general observational studies of sub Neptune exoplanets.},

Here, we evaluate the usefulness of carbon dioxide isotopologues as evidence of aerial life. Carbon isotopes are of particular interest as metabolic processes preferentially use the lighter \${\textasciicircum}\{12\}\$C over \${\textasciicircum}\{13\}\$C. In principle, the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be able to spectrally resolve the \${\textasciicircum}\{12\}\$C and \${\textasciicircum}\{13\}\$C isotopologues of CO\$\_\{2\}\$, but not CO and CH\$\_\{4\}\$. We simulated observations of CO\$\_\{2\}\$ isotopologues in the H\$\_\{2\}\$-dominated atmospheres of our nearest (\${\textless} 40\$ pc), temperate (equilibrium temperature of 250-350 K) sub-Neptunes with M dwarf host stars. We find \${\textasciicircum}\{13\}\$CO\$\_\{2\}\$ and \${\textasciicircum}\{12\}\$CO\$\_\{2\}\$ distinguishable if the atmosphere is H\$\_\{2\}\$-dominated with a few percentage points of CO\$\_\{2\}\$ for the most idealized target with an Earth-like composition of the two most abundant isotopologues, \${\textasciicircum}\{12\}\$CO\$\_\{2\}\$ and \${\textasciicircum}\{13\}\$CO\$\_\{2\}\$. With a Neptune-like metallicity of 100\${\textbackslash}times\$ solar and a C/O of 0.55, we are unable to distinguish between \${\textasciicircum}\{13\}\$CO\$\_\{2\}\$ and \${\textasciicircum}\{12\}\$CO\$\_\{2\}\$ in the atmospheres of temperate sub-Neptunes. If atmospheric composition largely follows metallicity scaling, the concentration of CO\$\_\{2\}\$ in a H\$\_\{2\}\$-dominated atmosphere will be too low to distinguish CO\$\_\{2\}\$ isotopologues with JWST. In contrast, at higher metallicities, there will be more CO\$\_\{2\}\$, but the smaller atmospheric scale height makes the measurement impossible. Carbon dioxide isotopologues are unlikely to be useful biosignature gases for the JWST era. Instead, isotopologue measurements should be used to evaluate formation mechanisms of planets and exoplanetary systems.},

	abstract = {The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will offer the ﬁrst opportunity to characterize terrestrial exoplanets with sufﬁcient precision to identify high mean molecular weight atmospheres, and TRAPPIST-1ʼs seven known transiting Earth-sized planets are particularly favorable targets. To assist community preparations for JWST observations, we use simulations of plausible post-ocean-loss and habitable environments for the TRAPPIST-1 exoplanets, and test simulations of all bright object time-series spectroscopy modes and all Mid-Infrared Instrument photometry ﬁlters to determine optimal observing strategies for atmospheric detection and characterization using both transmission and emission observations. We ﬁnd that transmission spectroscopy with the Near-Infrared Spectrograph Prism is optimal for detecting terrestrial, CO2-containing atmospheres, potentially in fewer than 10 transits for all seven TRAPPIST-1 planets, if they lack high-altitude aerosols. If the TRAPPIST-1 planets possess Venus-like H2SO4 aerosols, up to 12 times more transits may be required to detect an atmosphere. We present optimal instruments and observing modes for the detection of individual molecular species in a given terrestrial atmosphere and an observational strategy for discriminating between evolutionary states. We ﬁnd that water may be prohibitively difﬁcult to detect in both Venus-like and habitable atmospheres, due to its presence lower in the atmosphere where transmission spectra are less sensitive. Although the presence of biogenic O2 and O3 will be extremely challenging to detect, abiotically produced oxygen from past ocean loss may be detectable for all seven TRAPPIST-1 planets via O2–O2 collisionally induced absorption at 1.06 and 1.27 μm, or via NIR O3 features for the outer three planets. Our results constitute a suite of hypotheses on the nature and detectability of highly evolved terrestrial exoplanet atmospheres that may be tested with JWST.},

In this review we present our current understanding of the chemical processes active in pre- and protostellar environments that set the initial conditions for disks, and the disk chemical processes that evolve the chemical conditions during the first million years of planet formation. We review recent observational, laboratory and theoretical discoveries that have led to the present view of the chemical environment within which planets form, and their effects on the compositions of nascent planetary systems.

These time series observations were taken with the newly available spatial-scan mode that increases the duty cycle by nearly a factor of 2, thus improving the resulting photometric precision of the data. We measure a planetto-star radius ratio of Rp/R∗ = 0.117 09 ± 0.000 38 in the white light curve with the centre of transit occurring at 245 6114.345 ± 0.000 133 (JD). We achieve S/N levels per exposure of 1840 (0.061 per cent) at a resolution of λ = 19.2 nm (R ∼ 70) in the 1.1173–1.6549 µm spectral region, providing the precision necessary to probe the transmission spectrum of the planet at close to the resolution limit of the instrument. We compute the transmission spectrum using both single target and differential photometry with similar results. The resultant transmission spectrum shows a signiﬁcant absorption above the 5σ level matching the 1.4 µm water absorption band. In solar composition models, the water absorption is sensitive to the ∼1 m bar pressure levels at the terminator. The detected absorption agrees with that predicted by a 1000 K isothermal model, as well as with that predicted by a planetary-averaged temperature model.},

	abstract = {Two new methods are proposed for linear regression analysis for data with measurement errors. Both methods are designed to accommodate intrinsic scatter in addition to measurement errors. The first (BCES) is a direct extension of the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator to allow for measurement errors. It is quite general, allowing a) for measurement errors on both variables, b) the measurement errors for the two variables to be dependent, c) the magnitudes of the measurement errors to depend on the measurements, and d) other `symmetric' lines such as the bisector and the orthogonal regression can be constructed. The second method is a weighted least squares (WLS) estimator, which applies only in the case where the `independent' variable is measured without error and the magnitudes of the measurement errors on the 'dependent' variable are independent from the measurements. Several applications are made to extragalactic astronomy: The BCES method, when applied to data describing the color-luminosity relations for field galaxies, yields significantly different slopes than OLS and other estimators used in the literature. Simulations with artificial data sets are used to evaluate the small sample performance of the estimators. Unsurprisingly, the least-biased results are obtained when color is treated as the dependent variable. The Tully-Fisher relation is another example where the BCES method should be used because errors in luminosity and velocity are correlated due to inclination corrections. We also find, via simulations, that the WLS method is by far the best method for the Tolman surface-brightness test, producing the smallest variance in slope by an order of magnitude. Moreover, with WLS it is not necessary to ``reduce'' galaxies to a fiducial surface-brightness, since this model incorporates intrinsic scatter.},

The STIS spectra cover a wavelength range of 0.29–1.03 µm, with resolving power R = 500. The optical data are combined with archival near-infrared data from the HST Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) G141 grism, covering the wavelength range from 1.087 to 1.687 µm, with resolving power R = 130. We reach signal-to-noise levels between 3000 and 11 000 in 0.1 µm bins when measuring the transmission spectra from 0.53–1.687 µm. WASP-19 is known to be a very active star, with the optical stellar ﬂux varying by a few per cent over time. We correct the transit light curves for the effects of stellar activity using ground-based activity monitoring with the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory. While we were not able to construct a transmission spectrum using the blue optical data because of the presence of large occulted starspots, we were able to use the spot crossings to help constrain the mean stellar spot temperature. To search for predicted features in the hot-Jupiter atmosphere, in addition to the transmission spectrum we also deﬁne spectral indices for differential radius ( RP/R ) measurements to speciﬁcally search for the presence of TiO and alkali line features. Our measurements rule out TiO features predicted for a planet of WASP-19b’s equilibrium temperature (2050 K) in the transmission spectrum at the 2.7–2.9σ conﬁdence level, depending on atmospheric model formalism. The WFC3 transmission spectrum shows strong absorption features due to the presence of H2O, which is detected at the 4σ conﬁdence level between 1.1 and 1.4 µm. The transmission spectra results indicate that WASP-19b is a planet with no or low levels of TiO and without a high C/O ratio. The lack of observable TiO features are possibly due to rainout, breakdown from stellar activity or the presence of other absorbers in the optical.},

Debate rages on whether weak H2O features seen in exoplanet spectra are due to clouds or inherently depleted oxygen. Assertions of solar H2O abundances have relied on making a priori model assumptions, for example, chemical/radiative equilibrium. In this work, we attempt to address this problem with a new retrieval paradigm for transmission spectra. We introduce POSEIDON, a two-dimensional atmospheric retrieval algorithm including generalized inhomogeneous clouds. We demonstrate that this prescription allows one to break vital degeneracies between clouds and prominent molecular abundances. We apply POSEIDON to the best transmission spectrum presently available, for the hot Jupiter HD 209458b, uncovering new insights into its atmosphere at the day–night terminator. We extensively explore the parameter space with an unprecedented 108 models, spanning the continuum from fully cloudy to cloud-free atmospheres, in a fully Bayesian retrieval framework. We report the ﬁrst detection of nitrogen chemistry (NH3 and/or HCN) in an exoplanet atmosphere at 3.7–7.7σ conﬁdence, non-uniform cloud coverage at 4.5–5.4σ , high-altitude hazes at {\textgreater}3σ and sub-solar H2O at 3–5σ , depending on the assumed cloud distribution. We detect NH3 at 3.3σ , and 4.9σ for fully cloudy and cloud-free scenarios, respectively. For the model with the highest Bayesian evidence, we constrain H2O at 5–15 ppm (0.01–0.03) × solar and NH3 at 0.01–2.7 ppm, strongly suggesting disequilibrium chemistry and cautioning against equilibrium assumptions. Our results herald a new promise for retrieving cloudy atmospheres using high-precision Hubble Space Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope spectra.},

	abstract = {The computation of transmission spectra is a central ingredient in the study of exoplanetary atmospheres. First, we revisit the theory of transmission spectra, unifying ideas from several workers in the literature. Transmission spectra lack an absolute normalization due to the a priori unknown value of a reference transit radius, which is tied to an unknown reference pressure. We show that there is a degeneracy between the uncertainty in the transit radius, the assumed value of the reference pressure (typically set to 10 bar) and the inferred value of the water abundance when interpreting a Wide-Field Camera 3 (WFC3) transmission spectrum. Secondly, we show that the transmission spectra of isothermal atmospheres are nearly isobaric. We validate the isothermal, isobaric analytical formula for the transmission spectrum against full numerical calculations and show that the typical errors are ∼0.1 per cent (∼10 ppm) within the WFC3 range of wavelengths for temperatures of 1500 K (or higher). Thirdly, we generalize the previous expression for the transit radius to include a small temperature gradient. Finally, we analyse the measured WFC3 transmission spectrum of WASP-12b and demonstrate that we obtain consistent results with the retrieval approach of Kreidberg et al., if the reference transit radius and reference pressure are ﬁxed to assumed values. The unknown functional relationship between the reference transit radius and reference pressure implies that it is the product of the water abundance and reference pressure that is being retrieved from the data, and not just the water abundance alone. This degeneracy leads to a limitation on how accurately we may extract molecular abundances from transmission spectra using WFC3 data alone. We suggest an approximate expression for this relationship. Finally, we compare our study to that of Grifﬁth and discuss why the degeneracy was missed in previous retrieval studies.},

	abstract = {Infrared transmission and emission spectroscopy of exoplanets, recorded from primary transit and secondary eclipse measurements, indicate the presence of the most abundant carbon and oxygen molecular species (H2O, CH4, CO and CO2) in a few exoplanets. However, efforts to constrain the molecular abundances to within several orders of magnitude are thwarted by the broad range of degenerate solutions that fit the data. Here, we explore, with radiative transfer models and analytical approximations, the nature of the degenerate solution sets resulting from the sparse measurements of ‘hot Jupiter’ exoplanets. As demonstrated with simple analytical expressions, primary transit measurements probe roughly four atmospheric scale heights at each wavelength band. Derived mixing ratios from these data are highly sensitive to errors in the radius of the planet at a reference pressure. For example, an uncertainty of 1\% in the radius of a 1000 K and H2-based exoplanet with Jupiter's radius and mass causes an uncertainty of a factor of approximately 100–10 000 in the derived gas mixing ratios. The degree of sensitivity depends on how the line strength increases with the optical depth (i.e. the curve of growth) and the atmospheric scale height. Temperature degeneracies in the solutions of the primary transit data, which manifest their effects through the scale height and absorption coefficients, are smaller. We argue that these challenges can be partially surmounted by a combination of selected wavelength sampling of optical and infrared measurements and, when possible, the joint analysis of transit and secondary eclipse data of exoplanets. However, additional work is needed to constrain other effects, such as those owing to planetary clouds and star spots. Given the current range of open questions in the field, both observations and theory, there is a need for detailed measurements with space-based large mirror platforms (e.g. James web space telescope) and smaller broad survey telescopes as well as ground-based efforts.},

Here we construct interior structure models to derive Zp and atmospheric metallicity upper limits for 403 known transiting giant exoplanets. These limits are low enough that they can usefully inform atmosphere models. Additionally, we argue that comparing Zp to the observed atmospheric metallicity gives a useful measure of how well mixed metals are within the planet. This represents a new avenue for learning about planetary interiors. To aid in the future characterization of new planet discoveries we derive analytic prior predictions of atmosphere metallicity as a function of planet mass, and evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on Jupiter and Saturn.

Generally, however, these atmospheric studies have focused on individual planets, with the exception of a couple of works that have detected the presence of water vapor and clouds in populations of gaseous planets via transmission spectroscopy. Here, using a suite of retrieval tools, we analyze spectroscopic and photometric data of 25 hot Jupiters, obtained with the Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescopes via the eclipse technique. By applying the tools uniformly across the entire set of 25 planets, we extract robust trends in the thermal structure and chemical properties of hot Jupiters not obtained in past studies.

	abstract = {Methods. We observed 45 exoplanet host stars using the infrared dual imaging spectrograph of the Spectro-Polarimetric High-Contrast Exoplanet Research (SPHERE) instrument at the Very Large Telescope to search for potential companions. For each identiﬁed candidate companion we determined the probability that it is gravitationally bound to its host by performing common proper motion checks and modelling of synthetic stellar populations around the host. In addition, we derived contrast limits as a function of angular separation to set upper limits on further companions in these systems. We converted the derived contrast into mass thresholds using AMES-Cond, AMES-Dusty, and BT-Settl models.
Results. We detected new candidate companions around K2-38, WASP-72, WASP-80, WASP-87, WASP-88, WASP-108, WASP-118, WASP-120, WASP-122, WASP123, WASP-130, WASP-131, and WASP-137. The closest candidates were detected at separations of 0. 124 ± 0. 007 and 0. 189 ± 0. 003 around WASP-108 and WASP-131; the measured K-band contrasts indicate that these are stellar pcsettoaaanmrrsiypoaancmnosimoionnnpgs1a3nooiufoortn0hts.a3earr5grsee±ytpss0,tre.et0mhf2eesrMa,dbwelryeiavnpdedaedrr0timv.o6eufd2lmt+−ia00pu..00lml54itciuMiptllyteip,rslaryietcsesitpteiysemcf5str4ia.v.cO8et+−linyo69...na39Iv\%noecf.rlaO5ug5due.ir,4nwd+−g59ae..tt94har\%eeda.rocFeh-noedordetttahceoecmtnriaﬁoegpnrmnraeitnsauedndnyectaotctrnoievﬁnnertdmrsatuashbttai-otosfnsaym8os.5tpfelp±mereso0vf.w9i4oim0tuhsahlegyoctacktJenuanopntwriiatncenrcpgholuaomlnas--rt separation of 0. 5. This allows us to exclude additional stellar companions with masses higher than 0.08 M for almost all observed systems; around the closest and youngest systems, this sensitivity is achieved at physical separations as small as 10 au.
Conclusions. Our study shows that SPHERE is an ideal instrument for detecting and characterising close companions to exoplanetary host stars. Although the second data release of the Gaia mission also provides useful constraints for some of the systems, the achieved sensitivity provided by the current data release of this mission is not good enough to measure parallaxes and proper motions for all detected candidates. For 14 identiﬁed companion candidates further astrometric epochs are required to conﬁrm their common proper motion at 5σ signiﬁcance.},

	abstract = {We present Hubble Space Telescope optical and near-IR transmission spectra of the transiting hot-Jupiter WASP-31b. The spectrum covers 0.3–1.7 μm at a resolution R ∼ 70, which we combine with Spitzer photometry to cover the full-optical to IR. The spectrum is dominated by a cloud deck with a ﬂat transmission spectrum which is apparent at wavelengths {\textgreater}0.52 μm. The cloud deck is present at high altitudes and low pressures, as it covers the majority of the expected optical Na line and near-IR H2O features. While Na I absorption is not clearly identiﬁed, the resulting spectrum does show a very strong potassium feature detected at the 4.2σ conﬁdence level. Broadened alkali wings are not detected, indicating pressures below ∼10 mbar. The lack of Na and strong K is the ﬁrst indication of a sub-solar Na/K abundance ratio in a planetary atmosphere (ln[Na/K] = −3.3 ± 2.8), which could potentially be explained by Na condensation on the planet’s night side, or primordial abundance variations. A strong Rayleigh scattering signature is detected at short wavelengths, with a 4σ signiﬁcant slope. Two distinct aerosol size populations can explain the spectra, with a smaller sub-micron size grain population reaching high altitudes producing a blue Rayleigh scattering signature on top of a larger, lower lying population responsible for the ﬂat cloud deck at longer wavelengths. We estimate that the atmospheric circulation is sufﬁciently strong to mix micron size particles upwards to the required 1–10 mbar pressures, necessary to explain the cloud deck. These results further conﬁrm the importance of clouds in hot Jupiters, which can potentially dominate the overall spectra and may alter the abundances of key gaseous species.},

We find an eclipse depth averaged over this band equal to \$395{\textasciicircum}\{+69\}\_\{-45\}\$ parts per million, equivalent to a blackbody temperature of \$1788{\textbackslash}pm18\$K. We study and characterize several WFC3 instrumental effects, especially the "hook" phenomenon described by Deming et al. (2013). We use data from several transiting exoplanet systems to find a quantitative relation between the amplitude of the hook and the exposure level of a given pixel. Although the uncertainties in this relation are too large to allow us to develop an empirical correction for our data, our study provides a useful guide for optimizing exposure levels in future WFC3 observations. We derive the planet's spectrum using a differential method. The planet-to-star contrast increases to longer wavelength within the WFC3 bandpass, but without water absorption or emission to a \$3{\textbackslash}sigma\$ limit of 85 ppm. The slope of the WFC3 spectrum is significantly less than the slope of the best-fit blackbody. We compare all existing eclipse data for this planet to a blackbody spectrum, and to spectra from both solar abundance and carbon-rich (C/O=1) models. A blackbody spectrum is an acceptable fit to the full dataset. Extra continuous opacity due to clouds or haze, and flattened temperature profiles, are strong candidates to produce quasi-blackbody spectra, and to account for the amplitude of the optical eclipses. Our results show ambiguous evidence for a temperature inversion in this planet.},

We compare the transmission spectrum with hot-Jupiter atmospheric models including condensate-free and aerosol-dominated models incorporating Mie theory.

We have adopted it to include several methodologies for computing both direct and diffuse-scattering phase functions, and have added several updates including the ability to compute Raman scattering spectral features. Here we benchmark PICASO against two independent codes and discuss the degree to which the model is sensitive to a user’s speciﬁcation for various phase functions. Then, we conduct a full information-content study of the model across a wide parameter space in temperature, cloud proﬁle, signal-to-noise ratio, and resolving power.},

The transit chord moves slowly as an emergent feature of orbital precession excited by the oblate star with a decline rate in the impact parameter of db/dt = −0.011 yr−1, and with an actual value of b = 0.19 for the latest TESS measurements. The changing transit duration that was measured from Kepler Q2 and Q17 quarters and the TESS measurements indicates a linear drift of the impact parameter.

Our analysis combines data at two resolutions and applies a complete pixel-by-pixel limb-darkening correction to fully reveal the spectral line shapes of atmospheric absorption features. Terrestrial-based Na I and H I contamination are identified which mask the strong exoplanetary absorption signature in the Na core, which we find reaches total absorption levels of {\textasciitilde}0.11\% in a 4.4 Ang band. The Na spectral line profile is characterized by a wide absorption profile at the lowest absorption depths, and a sharp transition to a narrow absorption profile at higher absorption values. The transmission spectra also shows the presence of an additional absorber at {\textasciitilde}6,250 Ang, observed at both medium and low resolutions. We performed various limb-darkening tests, including using high precision limb-darkening measurements of the sun to characterize a general trend of Atlas models to slightly overestimate the amount of limb-darkening at all wavelengths, likely due to the limitations of the model's one-dimensional nature. We conclude that, despite these limitations, Atlas models can still successfully model limb-darkening in high signal-to-noise transits of solar-type stars, like HD209458, to a high level of precision over the entire optical regime (3,000-10,000 Ang) at transit phases between 2nd and 3rd contact.},

We obtain a null detection for the eclipse depth with state-of-the-art precision, -0.01 +- 0.10 ppt.

This is the first albedo constraint for HAT-P-32b, and the first z' band albedo value for any exoplanet. It disfavors the influence of large-sized silicate condensates on the planetary day side. We inferred z' band geometric albedo limits from published eclipse measurements also for the ultra-hot Jupiters WASP-12b, WASP-19b, WASP-103b, and WASP-121b, applying the same method.

Additionally, we further demonstrate that the cloud structure is sensitive to not only the cloud sedimentation efficiency (termed \$f\_\{{\textbackslash}textrm\{sed\}\}\$ in EddySed), but also the temperature-pressure profile of the deeper atmosphere. We briefly discuss the large difference between the resolved cloud structures of this work, adopting a phase-equilibrium and parameterised cloud model, and our previous work incorporating a cloud microphysical model, although a fairer comparison where, for example, the same list of constituent condensates is included in both treatments, is reserved for a future work. Our results underline the importance of further study into the potential condensate size distributions and vertical structures, as both strongly influence the radiative impact of clouds on the atmosphere. Finally, we present synthetic observations from our simulations reporting an improved match, over our previous cloud-free simulations, to the observed transmission, HST WFC3 emission and 4.5 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m Spitzer phase curve of HD 209458b.

We uniformly analyze 70 photometric light curves of 33 transiting planets using our custom pipeline, which implements pixel level decorrelation. We use this survey to understand how infrared photometry traces changes in atmospheric chemical properties as a function of planetary temperature. We compare our measurements to a grid of 1D radiative-convective equilibrium forward atmospheric models which include disequilibrium chemistry. We explore various strengths of vertical mixing (Kzz = 0 - 10{\textasciicircum}12 cm2/s) as well as two chemical compositions (1x and 30x solar). Results. We find that, on average, Spitzer probes a difference of 0.5 atmospheric scale heights between 3.6 and 4.5um, which is measured at 7.5sigma level of significance. We find that the coolest planets show a lack of methane compared to expectations, which has also been reported by previous studies of individual objects. We show that the sample of coolest planets rule out 1x solar composition with {\textgreater}3sigma confidence while supporting low vertical mixing (Kzz = 10{\textasciicircum}8 cm2/s). On the other hand, we find that the hot planets are best explained by models with 1x solar metallicity and high vertical mixing (Kzz = 10{\textasciicircum}12 cm2/s). We interpret this as the lofting of CH4 to the upper atmospheric layers. Changing the interior temperature changes the expectation for equilibrium chemistry in deep layers, hence the expectation of disequilibrium chemistry higher up. We also find a significant scatter in the transmission signatures of the mid-temperate and ultra-hot planets, likely due to increased atmospheric diversity, without the need to invoke higher metallicities. Additionally, we compare Spitzer transmission with emission for the same planets and find no evidence for correlation.},

              The temperature profile of a planetary atmosphere is a key diagnostic of radiative and dynamical processes governing the absorption, redistribution and emission of energy. Observations have revealed dayside stratospheres that either cool

Variations measured for a water vapour spectral feature reveal a temperature profile that transitions from warming with altitude on the dayside hemisphere to cooling with altitude on the nightside hemisphere. The data are well explained by models assuming chemical equilibrium, with water molecules thermally dissociating at low pressures on the dayside and recombining on the nightside

Of particular interest is the relationship between the albedo measured at superior conjunction, known as the ``geometric albedo", and the albedo considered over all orbital phase angles, known as the ``spherical albedo". Determining the relationship between the geometric and spherical albedos usually involves complex numerical calculations and closed-form solutions are restricted to simple reflection laws. Here we report the discovery of closed-form solutions for the geometric albedo and integral phase function, which apply to any law of reflection that only depends on the scattering angle. The shape of a reflected light phase curve, quantified by the integral phase function, and the secondary eclipse depth, quantified by the geometric albedo, may now be self-consistently inverted to retrieve globally averaged physical parameters. Fully Bayesian phase curve inversions for reflectance maps and simultaneous light curve detrending may now be performed due to the efficiency of computation. Demonstrating these innovations for the hot Jupiter Kepler-7b, we infer a geometric albedo of \$0.25{\textasciicircum}\{+0.01\}\_\{-0.02\}\$, a phase integral of \$1.77 {\textbackslash}pm0.07\$, a spherical albedo of \$0.44{\textasciicircum}\{+0.02\}\_\{-0.03\}\$ and a scattering asymmetry factor of \$0.07{\textasciicircum}\{+0.12\}\_\{-0.11\}\$.},

The previously estimated dayside temperature of about 1500 K implies that our geometric albedo measurement consists predominantly of reflected starlight and is largely uncontaminated by thermal emission. This makes the present result one of the most robust measurements of A\_g for any exoplanet. Our calculations of the bandpass-integrated geometric albedo demonstrate that the measured value of A\_g is consistent with a cloud-free atmosphere, where starlight is reflected via Rayleigh scattering by hydrogen molecules, and the water and sodium abundances are consistent with stellar metallicity. We predict that the bandpass-integrated TESS geometric albedo is too faint to detect and that a phase curve of HD 209458b observed by CHEOPS would have a distinct shape associated with Rayleigh scattering if the atmosphere is indeed cloud free.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08838},
	abstract = {Transit observations in the helium triplet around 10830 Angstrom are a successful tool to study exoplanetary atmospheres and their mass loss. Forming those lines requires ionisation and recombination of helium in the exoplanetary atmosphere. This ionisation is caused by stellar photons at extreme ultra-violet (EUV) wavelengths; however, no currently active telescopes can observe this part of the stellar spectrum. The relevant part of the stellar EUV spectrum consists of individual emission lines, many of them being formed by iron at coronal temperatures. The stellar iron abundance in the corona is often observed to be depleted for high-activity low-mass stars due to the first ionisation potential (FIP) effect. I show that stars with high versus low coronal iron abundances follow different scaling laws that tie together their X-ray emission and the narrow-band EUV flux that causes helium ionisation. I also show that the stellar iron to oxygen abundance ratio in the corona can be measured reasonably well from X-ray CCD spectra, yielding similar results to high-resolution X-ray observations. Taking coronal iron abundance into account, the currently observed large scatter in the relationship of EUV irradiation with exoplanetary helium transit depths can be reduced, improving the target selection criteria for exoplanet transmission spectroscopy. In particular, previously puzzling non-detections of helium for Neptunic exoplanets are now in line with expectations from the revised scaling laws.},

	abstract = {The equilibrium thermochemistry of the alkali elements in cool dwarf atmospheres is investigated as part of a comprehensive set of chemical equilibrium calculations. The abundances of all important gases and the condensation temperatures of all initial condensates for Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs are calculated as a function of pressure and temperature. Also discussed is the chemistry of refractory elements such as Al, Ca, Cr, Fe, Mg, Si, Ti, and V. The calculation of the alkali element and refractory element chemistry can help to constrain pressure and temperature conditions in dwarf atmospheres. A relative temperature scale is developed and compared to recent observations of the alkali elements in late-type dwarfs and brown dwarfs, such as the DENIS objects and Gliese 229B. The calculations show (1) Atomic Li gas abundances are expected to be lower than the bulk Li abundance because LiOH gas (at high total pressure) or LiCl gas (at low total pressure) form in very cool objects. Observations of only monatomic Li are therefore not a good test for the substellar nature of very cool objects. (2) The observations of atomic Cs in Gliese 229B can be understood by considering the distribution of Cs between atomic Cs and CsCl gases. (3) Liquid condensates, which may form solutions with complex compositions, form at higher pressures, and need to be considered in further atmospheric structure and opacity modeling.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.08759},
	abstract = {Ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs) are gas giants with very high equilibrium temperatures. In recent years, multiple chemical species, including various atoms and ions, have been discovered in their atmospheres. Most of these observations have been performed with transmission spectroscopy, although UHJs are also ideal targets for emission spectroscopy due to their strong thermal radiation. We present high-resolution thermal emission spectroscopy of the transiting UHJ KELT-20b/MASCARA-2b. The observation was performed with the CARMENES spectrograph at orbital phases before and after the secondary eclipse. We detected atomic Fe using the cross-correlation technique. The detected Fe lines are in emission, which unambiguously indicates a temperature inversion on the dayside hemisphere. We furthermore retrieved the temperature structure with the detected Fe lines. The result shows that the atmosphere has a strong temperature inversion with a temperature of \$4900{\textbackslash}pm\{700\}\$ K and a pressure of \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-4.8\_\{-1.1\}{\textasciicircum}\{+1.0\}\}\$ bar at the upper layer of the inversion. A joint retrieval of the CARMENES data and the TESS secondary eclipse data returns a temperature of \$2550\_\{-250\}{\textasciicircum}\{+150\}\$ K and a pressure of \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-1.5\_\{-0.6\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.7\}\}\$ bar at the lower layer of the temperature inversion. The detection of such a strong temperature inversion is consistent with theoretical simulations that predict an inversion layer on the dayside of UHJs. The joint retrieval of the CARMENES and TESS data demonstrates the power of combing high-resolution emission spectroscopy with secondary eclipse photometry in characterizing atmospheric temperature structures.},

	abstract = {Several results indicate that the atmospheric temperature of the ultra-hot Jupiter KELT-9b in the main line formation region is a few thousand degrees higher than predicted by self-consistent models. We test whether non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) effects are responsible for the presumably higher temperature. We employ the Cloudy NLTE radiative transfer code to self-consistently compute the upper atmospheric temperature-pressure (TP) profile of KELT-9b, assuming solar metallicity. The Cloudy NLTE TP profile is \${\textbackslash}approx\$2000 K hotter than that obtained with previous models assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). In particular, in the 1-10\${\textasciicircum}\{-7\}\$ bar range the temperature increases from \${\textbackslash}approx\$4000 K to \${\textbackslash}approx\$8500 K, remaining roughly constant at lower pressures. We find that the high temperature in the upper atmosphere of KELT-9b is driven principally by NLTE effects modifying the Fe and Mg level populations, which strongly influence the atmospheric thermal balance. We employ Cloudy to compute LTE and NLTE synthetic transmission spectra on the basis of the TP profiles computed in LTE and NLTE, respectively, finding that the NLTE model generally produces stronger absorption lines than the LTE model (up to 30\%), which is largest in the ultraviolet. We compare the NLTE synthetic transmission spectrum with the observed H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ and H\${\textbackslash}beta\$ line profiles obtaining an excellent match, thus supporting our results. The NLTE synthetic transmission spectrum can be used to guide future observations aiming at detecting features in the planet's transmission spectrum. Metals, such as Mg and Fe, and NLTE effects shape the upper atmospheric temperature structure of KELT-9b and thus affect the mass-loss rates derived from it. Finally, our results call for checking whether this is the case also of cooler planets.},

	abstract = {Know thy star, know thy planetary atmosphere. Every exoplanet with atmospheric measurements orbits around a star, and the stellar environment directly affects the planetary atmosphere. Here we present the emission spectrum of ultra-hot Jupiter KELT-20b which provides an observational link between host-star properties and planet atmospheric thermal structure. It is currently the only planet with thermal emission measurements in the Teq ∼ 2200 K range that orbits around an early A-type star. By comparing it with other similar ultra-hot Jupiters around FGK stars, we can better understand how different host-star types inﬂuence planetary atmospheres. The emission spectrum covers 0.6–4.5 μm with data from TESS, HST WFC3/G141, and Spitzer 4.5 μm channel. KELT-20b has a 1.4 μm water feature strength metric of SH2O = −0.097 ± 0.02 and a blackbody brightness temperature difference of 528 K between WFC3/G141 (Tb = 2402 ± 14 K) and Spitzer 4.5 μm channel (Tb = 2930 ± 59 K). These very large H2O and CO emission features combined with the A-type host star make KELT-20b a unique planet among other similar hot Jupiters. The abundant FUV, NUV, and optical radiation from its host star (Teff = 8720 ± 250 K) is expected to be the key that drives its strong thermal inversion and prominent emission features based on previous PHOENIX model calculations.},

Here, we present observations of the thermal emission spectrum of an ultra-hot Jupiter, WASP-189b, at high spectral resolution using the HARPS-N spectrograph. Using the cross-correlation technique, we detect a strong Fe I signal. The detected Fe I spectral lines are found in emission, which is direct evidence of a temperature inversion in the planetary atmosphere. We further performed a retrieval on the observed spectrum using a forward model with an MCMC approach. When assuming a solar metallicity, the best-fit result returns a temperature of K at the top of the inversion, which is significantly hotter than the planetary equilibrium temperature (2641 K). The temperature at the bottom of the inversion is determined as K. Such a strong temperature inversion is probably created by the absorption of atomic species like Fe I.},

	abstract = {A new class of exoplanets has emerged: the ultra hot Jupiters, the hottest close-in gas giants. Most of them have weaker than expected spectral features in the \$1.1-1.7{\textbackslash}mu m\$ bandpass probed by HST/WFC3 but stronger spectral features at longer wavelengths probed by Spitzer. This led previous authors to puzzling conclusions about the thermal structures and chemical abundances of these planets. Using the SPARC/MITgcm, we investigate how thermal dissociation, ionization, H\${\textasciicircum}-\$ opacity and clouds shape the thermal structures and spectral properties of ultra hot Jupiters with a special focus on WASP-121b. We expand our findings to the whole population of ultra hot Jupiters through analytical quantification of the thermal dissociation and its influence on the strength of spectral features. We predict that most molecules are thermally dissociated and alkalies are ionized in the dayside photospheres of ultra hot Jupiters. This includes H\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm 2\}\$O, TiO, VO, and H\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm 2\}\$ but not CO, which has a stronger molecular bond. The vertical molecular gradient created by the dissociation significantly weakens the spectral features from water while the \$4.5{\textbackslash}mu m\$ CO feature remain unchanged. The water band in the HST/WFC3 bandpass is further weakened by H\${\textasciicircum}-\$ continuum opacity. Molecules are expected to recombine before reaching the limb, leading to order of magnitude variations of the chemical composition and cloud coverage between the limb and the dayside. Overall, molecular dissociation provides a qualitative understanding of the lack of strong spectral feature of water in the \$1-2{\textbackslash}mu m\$ bandpass observed in most ultra hot Jupiters. Quantitatively, however, our model does not provide a satisfactory match to the WASP-121b emission spectrum. Together with WASP-33b and Kepler-33Ab, they seem the outliers among the population of ultra hot Jupiters in need of a more thorough understanding.},

Out of the 15 transiting systems selected for analysis, seven - HAT-P-7, KELT-1, KELT-9, KELT-16, KELT-20, Kepler-13A, and WASP-12 - show statistically significant secondary eclipses and day-night atmospheric brightness modulations. Small eastward dayside hotspot offsets were measured for KELT-9b and WASP-12b. KELT-1, Kepler-13A, and WASP-12 show additional phase-curve variability attributed to the tidal distortion of the host star; the amplitudes of these signals are consistent with theoretical predictions. We combined occultation measurements from TESS and Spitzer to compute dayside brightness temperatures, TESS-band geometric albedos, Bond albedos, and phase integrals for several systems. The new albedo values solidify the previously reported trend between dayside temperature and geometric albedo for planets with \$1500{\textless}T\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{day\}\}{\textless}3000\$ K. For Kepler-13Ab, we carried out an atmospheric retrieval of the full secondary eclipse spectrum, which revealed a non-inverted temperature-pressure profile, significant H\$\_\{2\}\$O and K absorption in the near-infrared, evidence for strong optical atmospheric opacity due to sodium, and a confirmation of the high geometric albedo inferred from our simpler analysis. We explore the implications of the phase integrals (ratios of Bond to geometric albedos) for understanding exoplanet clouds.

These kind of objects are perfect laboratories to study chemistry of exoplanetary upper atmospheres via transmission spectroscopy. Exo-atmospheric absorption features are buried in the noise of the in-transit residual spectra. However we can retrieve the information of hundreds of atmospheric absorption lines by performing a cross-correlation with an atmospheric transmission model, which allows us to greatly increase the exo-atmospheric signal. At the high-spectral resolution of our data, the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect and centre-to-limb variation have a strong contribution. Here, we present the first detection of Fe I and the confirmation of absorption features of Fe II in the atmosphere of the ultra-hot Jupiter MASCARA-2b/KELT-20b, by using three transit observations with HARPS-N. After combining all transit observations we find a high cross-correlation signal of Fe I and Fe II with signal-to-noise ratios of 10.5 +/- 0.4 and 8.6 +/- 0.5, respectively. The peak absorption for both species appear to be blue-shifted with velocities of -6.3 +/- 0.8 km/s for Fe I and -2.8 +/- 0.8 km/s for Fe II, suggesting the presence of winds from the day- to night-side of the planet's atmosphere. These results confirm previous studies of this planet and add a new atomic species (Fe I) to the long list of detected species in the atmosphere of MASCARA-2b, making it, together with KELT-9b, the most feature-rich ultra-hot Jupiter to date.},

We used the mean line proﬁle residuals tomography to analyse the planetary atmospheric signal and its variations. We also used the cross-correlation method to study a previously reported double-peak feature in the FeI planetary signal.
Results. We observed both the classical and the atmospheric Rossiter-McLaughlin effect in the radial velocity time-series. The latter gave us an estimate of the radius of the planetary atmosphere that correlates with the stellar mask used in our work (Rp+atmo/Rp = 1.13 ± 0.02). We isolated the of the planetary atmospheric signal during planetary atmospheric transit with an overall trace in the blueshift of tomography, and we found radial velocity ≈10 km s−1, along with small variations in variations the signal depth, and less signiﬁcant, in the full width at half maximum (FWHM). We also ﬁnd a possible variation in the structure and position of the FeI signal in different transits.
Conclusions. We conﬁrm the previously detected blueshift of the atmospheric signal during the transit. The FWHM variations of the atmospheric signal, if conﬁrmed, may be caused by more turbulent condition at the beginning of the transit, by a variable contribution of the elements present in the stellar mask to the overall planetary atmospheric signal, or by iron condensation. The FeI signal show indications of variability from one transit to the next.},

	abstract = {Ultra-hot Jupiters orbit very close to their host star and consequently receive strong irradiation, causing their atmospheric chemistry to be different from the common gas giants. Here, we have studied the atmosphere of one of these particular hot planets, MASCARA2b/KELT-20b, using four transit observations with high resolution spectroscopy facilities. Three of these observations were performed with HARPS-N and one with CARMENES. Additionally, we simultaneously observed one of the transits with MuSCAT2 to monitor possible spots in the stellar surface. At high resolution, the transmission residuals show the effects of Rossiter-McLaughlin and centreto-limb variations from the stellar lines proﬁles, which we have corrected to ﬁnally extract the transmission spectra of the planet. We clearly observe the absorption features of CaII, FeII, NaI, Hα, and Hβ in the atmosphere of MASCARA-2b, and indications of Hγ and MgI at low signal-to-noise ratio. In the case of NaI, the true absorption is difﬁcult to disentangle from the strong telluric and interstellar contamination. The results obtained with CARMENES and HARPS-N are consistent, measuring an Hα absorption depth of 0.68 ± 0.05 and 0.59 ± 0.07\%, and NaI absorption of 0.11 ± 0.04 and 0.09 ± 0.05\% for a 0.75 Å passband, in the two instruments respectively. The Hα absorption corresponds to ∼1.2 Rp, which implies an expanded atmosphere, as a result of the gas heating caused by the irradiation received from the host star. For Hβ and Hγ only HARPS-N covers this wavelength range, measuring an absorption depth of 0.28 ± 0.06 and 0.21 ± 0.07\%, respectively. For CaII, only CARMENES covers this wavelength range measuring an absorption depth of 0.28 ± 0.05, 0.41 ± 0.05 and 0.27 ± 0.06\% for CaII λ8498Å, λ8542Å and λ8662Å lines, respectively. Three additional absorption lines of FeII are observed in the transmission spectrum by HARPS-N (partially covered by CARMENES), measuring an average absorption depth of 0.08 ± 0.04\% (0.75 Å passband). The results presented here are consistent with theoretical models of ultra-hot Jupiters atmospheres, suggesting the emergence of an ionised gas on the day-side of such planets. Calcium and iron, together with other elements, are expected to be singly ionised at these temperatures and be more numerous than its neutral state. The Calcium triplet lines are detected here for the ﬁrst time in transmission in an exoplanet atmosphere.},

	abstract = {We analyse the transmission spectra of KELT-20b/MASCARA-2b to search for possible thermal inversion agents. The data consist of three transits obtained using HARPSN and one using CARMENES. We removed stellar and telluric lines before cross-correlating the residuals with spectroscopic templates produced using a 1D plane-parallel model, assuming an isothermal atmosphere and chemical equilibrium at solar metallicity. Using a likelihoodmapping method, we detect Fe I at {\textgreater} 13σ , Ca II H\&K at {\textgreater} 6σ and conﬁrm the previous detections of Fe II, Ca II IR Triplet, and Na I D. The detected signal of Fe I is shifted by −3.4 ± 0.4 km s−1 from the planetary rest frame, which indicates a strong day–night wind. Our likelihood-mapping technique also reveals that the absorption features of the detected species extend to different altitudes in the planet’s atmosphere. Assuming that the line lists are accurate, we do not detect other potential thermal inversion agents (NaH, MgH, AlO, SH, CaO, VO, FeH, and TiO) suggesting that non-chemical equilibrium mechanisms (e.g. a coldtrap) might have removed Ti- and V-bearing species from the upper atmosphere. Our results, therefore, show that KELT-20b/MASCARA-2b cannot possess an inversion layer caused by a TiO/VO-related mechanism. The presence of an inversion layer would therefore likely be caused by metal atoms such as Fe I and Fe II. Finally, we report a double-peak structure in the Fe I signal in all of our data sets that could be a signature of atmospheric dynamics. However, further investigation is needed to robustly determine the origin of the signal.},

These distortions, if uncorrected for, lead to the retrieval of erroneous system parameters and may even lead to some planetary candidates being rejected as ostensibly unphysical. We provide analytic expressions for estimating the disturbance to the various light-curve parameters as a function of the integration time. These effects are particularly crucial in light of the long-cadence photometry often used for discovering new exoplanets by, for example, Convection Rotation and Planetary Transits (CoRoT) and the Kepler Missions (8.5 and 30 min). One of the dominant effects of long integration times is a systematic underestimation of the light-curve-derived stellar density, which has signiﬁcant ramiﬁcations for transit surveys. We present a discussion of numerical integration techniques to compensate for the effects and produce expressions to quickly estimate the errors of such methods, as a function of integration time and numerical resolution. This allows for an economic choice of resolution before attempting ﬁts of long-cadence light-curves. We provide a comparison of the short- and long-cadence light curves of TrES-2b and show that the retrieved transit parameters are consistent using the techniques discussed here.},

A practical and straightforward method of determining the power spectral density of the frequency fluctuations from the variance of the frequency fluctuations, the sampling time, the number of samples taken, and the dependence on system bandwidth is also developed. Additional insight is also given into some of the problems that arise from the presence of "flicker noise" (spectrum proportional to {\textbar}ω{\textbar}-1) modulation of the frequency of an oscillator. The theory is applied in classifying the types of noise on the signals of frequency standards made available at NBS, Boulder Laboratories, such as: masers (both H and N15H3), the cesium beam frequency standard employed as the U. S. Frequency Standard, and rubidium gas cells. "Flicker noise" frequency modulation was not observed on the signals of masers for sampling times ranging from 0.1 second to 4 hours. In a comparison between the NBS hydrogen maser and the NBS III cesium beam, uncorrelated random noise was observed on the frequency fluctuations for sampling times extending to 4 hours; the fractional standard deviations of the frequency fluctuations were as low as 5 parts in 1014.},

This is a considerable improvement to the 90 ppm precision we achieved previously for a single eclipse observation using the same observing set-up. Combining these data with those reported at other wavelengths, a blackbody spectrum for WASP-121b is ruled out at {\textgreater}6σ conﬁdence and we conﬁrm the interpretation of previous retrieval analyses that found the data are best explained by a dayside thermal inversion. The updated spectrum clearly resolves the water emission band at 1.3–1.6 μm, with higher signalto-noise than before. It also fails to reproduce a bump in the spectrum at 1.25 μm derived from the ﬁrst eclipse observation, which had tentatively been attributed to VO emission. We conclude that the latter was either a statistical ﬂuctuation or a systematic artefact speciﬁc to the ﬁrst eclipse data set.},

	abstract = {We present an atmospheric transmission spectrum for the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-121b, measured using the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph on board the Hubble Space Telescope. Across the 0.47–1 mm wavelength range, the data imply an atmospheric opacity comparable to—and in some spectroscopic channels exceeding—that previously measured at near-infrared wavelengths (1.15–1.65 mm). Wavelength-dependent variations in the opacity rule out a gray cloud deck at a conﬁdence level of 3.7σ and may instead be explained by VO spectral bands. We ﬁnd a cloud-free model assuming chemical equilibrium for a temperature of 1500 K and a metal enrichment of 10–30× solar matches these data well. Using a free-chemistry retrieval analysis, we estimate a VO abundance of -6.6-+00..32 dex. We ﬁnd no evidence for TiO and place a 3σ upper limit of −7.9 dex on its abundance, suggesting TiO may have condensed from the gas phase at the day–night limb. The opacity rises steeply at the shortest wavelengths, increasing by approximately ﬁve pressure scale heights from 0.47 to 0.3 mm in wavelength. If this feature is caused by Rayleigh scattering due to uniformly distributed aerosols, it would imply an unphysically high temperature of 6810±1530 K. One alternative explanation for the short-wavelength rise is absorption due to SH (mercapto radical), which has been predicted as an important product of non-equilibrium chemistry in hot Jupiter atmospheres. Irrespective of the identity of the NUV absorber, it likely captures a signiﬁcant amount of incident stellar radiation at low pressures, thus playing a signiﬁcant role in the overall energy budget, thermal structure, and circulation of the atmosphere.},

We measure the planet's normalized day-night contrast as {\textgreater}0.96 in luminosity: the disk-integrated dayside emission from the planet is at 964+-25 ppm, corresponding to 2894+-30 K, and we place an upper limit on the nightside emission of {\textless}32ppm or 1430K at the 3-sigma level. We also find that the peak of the phase curve exhibits a small, but significant offset in brightness of 4.5+-0.5 degrees eastward. We compare the extracted phase curve and phase resolved spectra to 3D Global Circulation Models and find that broadly the data can be well reproduced by some of these models. We find from this comparison several constraints on the atmospheric properties of the planet. Firstly we find that we need efficient drag to explain the very inefficient day-night re-circulation observed. We demonstrate that this drag could be due to Lorentz-force drag by a magnetic field as weak as 10 Gauss. Secondly, we show that a high metallicity is not required to match the large day-night temperature contrast. In fact, the effect of metallicity on the phase curve is different from cooler gas-giant counterparts, due to the high-temperature chemistry in WASP-18b's atmosphere. Additionally, we compare the current UHJ spectroscopic phase curves, WASP-18b and WASP-103b, and show that these two planets provide a consistent picture with remarkable similarities in their measured and inferred properties. However, key differences in these properties, such as their brightness offsets and radius anomalies, suggest that UHJ could be used to separate between competing theories for the inflation of gas-giant planets.},

We combine five secondary eclipses of the hot Jupiter WASP-18 b (Tday=2900K) that we secured between 1.1 and 1.7 micron with the WFC3 instrument aboard the Hubble Space Telescope. Our extracted spectrum (S/N=50, R=40) does not exhibit clearly identifiable molecular features but is poorly matched by a blackbody spectrum. We complement this data with previously published Spitzer/IRAC observations of this target and interpret the combined spectrum by computing a grid of self-consistent, 1D forward models, varying the composition and energy budget. At these high temperatures, we find there are important contributions to the overall opacity from H- ions, as well as the removal of major molecules by thermal dissociation (including water), and thermal ionization of metals. These effects were omitted in previous spectral retrievals for very hot gas giants, and we argue that they must be included to properly interpret the spectra of these objects. We infer a new metallicity and C/O ratio for WASP-18 b, and find them well constrained to be solar ([M/H]=-0.01 (0.35), C/O{\textless}0.85 at 3 sigma confidence level), unlike previous work but in line with expectations for giant planets. The best fitting self-consistent temperature-pressure profiles are inverted, resulting in an emission feature at 4.5 micron seen in the Spitzer photometry. These results further strengthen the evidence that the family of very hot gas giant exoplanets commonly exhibit thermal inversions.},

	abstract = {The emergent spectra of close-in, giant exoplanets ("hot Jupiters") are expected to be distinct from those of self-luminous objects with similar effective temperatures because hot Jupiters are primarily heated from above by their host stars rather than internally from the release of energy from their formation. Theoretical models predict a continuum of dayside spectra for hot Jupiters as a function of irradiation level, with the coolest planets having absorption features in their spectra, intermediate-temperature planets having emission features due to thermal inversions, and the hottest planets having blackbody-like spectra due to molecular dissociation and continuum opacity from the H- ion. Absorption and emission features have been detected in the spectra of a number of individual hot Jupiters, and population-level trends have been observed in photometric measurements. However, there has been no unified, population-level study of the thermal emission spectra of hot Jupiters such as has been done for cooler brown dwarfs and transmission spectra of hot Jupiters. Here we show that hot Jupiter secondary eclipse spectra centered around a water absorption band at 1.4 microns follow a common trend in water feature strength with temperature. The observed trend is broadly consistent with model predictions for how the thermal structures of solar-composition planets vary with irradiation level. Nevertheless, the ensemble of planets exhibits some degree of scatter around the mean trend for solar composition planets. The spread can be accounted for if the planets have modest variations in metallicity and/or elemental abundance ratios, which is expected from planet formation models. (abridged abstract)},

	abstract = {Observations of exoplanet atmospheres have shown that aerosols, like in the Solar System, are common across a variety of temperatures and planet types. The formation and distribution of these aerosols are inextricably intertwined with the composition and thermal structure of the atmosphere. At the same time, these aerosols also interfere with our probes of atmospheric composition and thermal structure, and thus a better understanding of aerosols lead to a better understanding of exoplanet atmospheres as a whole. Here we review the current state of knowledge of exoplanet aerosols as determined from observations, modeling, and laboratory experiments. Measurements of the transmission spectra, dayside emission, and phase curves of transiting exoplanets, as well as the emission spectrum and light curves of directly imaged exoplanets and brown dwarfs have shown that aerosols are distributed inhomogeneously in exoplanet atmospheres, with aerosol distributions varying significantly with planet equilibrium temperature and gravity. Parameterized and microphysical models predict that these aerosols are likely composed of oxidized minerals like silicates for the hottest exoplanets, while at lower temperatures the dominant aerosols may be composed of alkali salts and sulfides. Particles originating from photochemical processes are also likely at low temperatures, though their formation process is highly complex, as revealed by laboratory work. In the years to come, new ground- and space-based observatories will have the capability to assess the composition of exoplanet aerosols, while new modeling and laboratory efforts will improve upon our picture of aerosol formation and dynamics.},

	abstract = {Nine transiting Earth-sized planets have recently been discovered around nearby late-M dwarfs, including the TRAPPIST-1 planets and two planets discovered by the MEarth survey, GJ 1132b and LHS 1140b. These planets are the smallest known planets that may have atmospheres amenable to detection with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We present model thermal emission and transmission spectra for each planet, varying composition and surface pressure of the atmosphere. We base elemental compositions on those of Earth, Titan, and Venus and calculate the molecular compositions assuming chemical equilibrium, which can strongly depend on temperature. Both thermal emission and transmission spectra are sensitive to the atmospheric composition; thermal emission spectra are sensitive to surface pressure and temperature. We predict the observability of each planet’s atmosphere with JWST. GJ 1132b and TRAPPIST-1b are excellent targets for emission spectroscopy with JWST/ MIRI, requiring fewer than 10 eclipse observations. Emission photometry for TRAPPIST-1c requires 5–15 eclipses; LHS 1140b and TRAPPIST-1d, TRAPPIST-1e, and TRAPPIST-1f, which could possibly have surface liquid water, may be accessible with photometry. Seven of the nine planets are strong candidates for transmission spectroscopy measurements with JWST, although the number of transits required depends strongly on the planets’ actual masses. Using the measured masses, fewer than 20 transits are required for a 5σ detection of spectral features for GJ 1132b and six of the TRAPPIST-1 planets. Dedicated campaigns to measure the atmospheres of these nine planets will allow us, for the ﬁrst time, to probe formation and evolution processes of terrestrial planetary atmospheres beyond our solar system.},

	abstract = {Recent studies of ultra hot-Jupiters suggested that their atmospheres could have thermal inversions due to the presence of optical absorbers such as TiO, VO, FeH and other metal hydride/oxides. However, it is expected that these molecules would thermally dissociate at extremely high temperatures, thus leading to featureless spectra in the infrared. KELT-9b, the hottest exoplanet discovered so far, is thought to belong to this regime and host an atmosphere dominated by neutral Hydrogen from dissociation and atomic/ionic species. Here, we analysed the eclipse spectrum obtained using the Hubble Space Telescope's Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) and, by utilising the atmospheric retrieval code TauREx3, found that the spectrum is consistent with the presence of molecular species and is poorly fitted by a simple blackbody. In particular, we find that a combination of TiO, VO, FeH and H- provides the best-fit when considering HST, Spitzer and TESS datasets together. Aware of potential biases when combining instruments, we also analysed the HST spectrum alone and found that TiO and VO only were needed in this case. These findings paint a more complex picture of the atmospheres of ultra-hot planets than previously thought},

	abstract = {A new class of exoplanets is beginning to emerge: planets with dayside atmospheres that resemble stellar atmospheres as most of their molecular constituents dissociate. The effects of the dissociation of these species will be varied and must be carefully accounted for. Here we take the ﬁrst steps toward understanding the consequences of dissociation and recombination of molecular hydrogen (H2) on atmospheric heat recirculation. Using a simple energy balance model with eastward winds, we demonstrate that H2 dissociation/recombination can signiﬁcantly increase the day–night heat transport on ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs): gas giant exoplanets where signiﬁcant H2 dissociation occurs. The atomic hydrogen from the highly irradiated daysides of UHJs will transport some of the energy deposited on the dayside toward the nightside of the planet where the H atoms recombine into H2; this mechanism bears similarities to latent heat. Given a ﬁxed wind speed, this will act to increase the heat recirculation efﬁciency; alternatively, a measured heat recirculation efﬁciency will require slower wind speeds after accounting for H2 dissociation/recombination.},

Thermal flux from the nightside of several hot Jupiters has been measured, meaning energy is transported from day to night in some fashion. However, it is not clear exactly what the physical information from these detections reveals about the atmospheric dynamics of hot Jupiters. Here we show that the nightside effective temperatures of a sample of 12 hot Jupiters are clustered around 1100 K, with a slight upward trend as a function of stellar irradiation. The clustering is not predicted by cloud-free atmospheric circulation models. This result can be explained if most hot Jupiters have nightside clouds that are optically thick to outgoing longwave radiation and hence radiate at the cloud-top temperature, and progressively disperse for planets receiving greater incident flux. Phase curve observations at a greater range of wavelengths are crucial to determining the extent of cloud coverage, as well as the cloud composition on hot Jupiter nightsides.},

	abstract = {Secondary eclipse observations of ultra-hot Jupiters have found evidence that hydrogen is dissociated on their daysides. Additionally, full-phase light curve observations of ultra-hot Jupiters show a smaller day-night emitted flux contrast than that expected from previous theory. Recently, it was proposed by Bell \& Cowan (2018) that the heat intake to dissociate hydrogen and heat release due to recombination of dissociated hydrogen can affect the atmospheric circulation of ultra-hot Jupiters. In this work, we add cooling/heating due to dissociation/recombination into the analytic theory of Komacek \& Showman (2016) and Zhang \& Showman (2017) for the dayside-nightside temperature contrasts of hot Jupiters. We find that at high values of incident stellar flux, the day-night temperature contrast of ultra-hot Jupiters may decrease with increasing incident stellar flux due to dissociation/recombination, the opposite of that expected without including the effects of dissociation/recombination. We propose that a combination of a greater number of full-phase light curve observations of ultra-hot Jupiters and future General Circulation Models that include the effects of dissociation/recombination could determine in detail how the atmospheric circulation of ultra-hot Jupiters differs from that of cooler planets.},

	abstract = {The full-phase infrared light curves of low-eccentricity hot Jupiters show a trend of increasing fractional dayside–nightside brightness temperature difference with increasing incident stellar ﬂux, both averaged across the infrared and in each individual wavelength band. The analytic theory of Komacek \& Showman shows that this trend is due to the decreasing ability with increasing incident stellar ﬂux of waves to propagate from day to night and erase temperature differences. Here, we compare the predictions of this theory with observations, showing that it explains well the shape of the trend of increasing dayside–nightside temperature difference with increasing equilibrium temperature. Applied to individual planets, the theory matches well with observations at high equilibrium temperatures but, for a ﬁxed photosphere pressure of 100 mbar, systematically underpredicts the dayside–nightside brightness temperature differences at equilibrium temperatures less than 2000 K. We interpret this as being due to the effects of a process that moves the infrared photospheres of these cooler hot Jupiters to lower pressures. We also utilize general circulation modeling with double-gray radiative transfer to explore how the circulation changes with equilibrium temperature and drag strengths. As expected from our theory, the dayside–nightside temperature differences from our numerical simulations increase with increasing incident stellar ﬂux and drag strengths. We calculate model phase curves using our general circulation models, from which we compare the broadband infrared offset from the substellar point and dayside–nightside brightness temperature differences against observations, ﬁnding that strong drag or additional effects (e.g., clouds and/or supersolar metallicities) are necessary to explain many observed phase curves.},

This inclination makes possible investigations of the planet atmosphere. In this paper we discuss the planet transmission spectra during a transit. The basic tenet of the method is that the planet atmosphere absorption features will be superimposed on the stellar flux as the stellar flux passes through the planet atmosphere above the limb. The ratio of the planet's transparent atmosphere area to the star area is small, approximately 10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\} to 10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\}; for this method to work very strong planet spectral features are necessary. We use our models of close-in extrasolar giant planets to estimate promising absorption signatures: the alkali metal lines, in particular the Na I and K I resonance doublets, and the He I \$2{\textasciicircum}3S\$ - \$2{\textasciicircum}3P\$ triplet line at 1083.0 nm. If successful, observations will constrain the line-of-sight temperature, pressure, and density. The most important point is that observations will constrain the cloud depth, which in turn will distinguish between different atmosphere models. We also discuss the potential of this method for EGPs at different orbital distances and orbiting non-solar-type stars.},

A strong absorption signal is detected in the near-infrared He I triplet at 10830 Å in all three transits. During mid-transit, the mean absorption level is 0.88 ± 0.04\% measured in a ±10 km s−1 range at a net blueshift of −3.5 ± 0.4 km s−1 (10829.84–10830.57 Å). The absorption signal exhibits radial velocities of +6.5 ± 3.1 km s−1 and −12.6 ± 1.0 km s−1 during ingress and egress, respectively; all radial velocities are measured in the planetary rest frame. We show that stellar activity related pseudo-signals interfere with the planetary atmospheric absorption signal. They could contribute as much as 80\% of the observed signal and might also affect the observed radial velocity signature, but pseudo-signals are very unlikely to explain the entire signal. The observed line ratio between the two unresolved and the third line of the He I triplet is 2.8 ± 0.2, which strongly deviates from the value expected for an optically thin atmospheres. When interpreted in terms of absorption in the planetary atmosphere, this favors a compact helium atmosphere with an extent of only 0.2 planetary radii and a substantial column density on the order of 4 × 1012 cm−2. The observed radial velocities can be understood either in terms of atmospheric circulation with equatorial superrotation or as a sign of an asymmetric atmospheric component of evaporating material. We detect no clear signature of ongoing evaporation, like pre- or post-transit absorption, which could indicate material beyond the planetary Roche lobe, or radial velocities in excess of the escape velocity. These ﬁndings do not contradict planetary evaporation, but only show that the detected helium absorption in HD 189733 b does not trace the atmospheric layers that show pronounced escape signatures.},

Results. We detect an excess helium absorption signature of 5.54 ± 0.27\% (20σ) in the planet rest frame during the transit. The detection is in agreement with the previous detection achieved with HST/WFC3. The signature shows an excess absorption in the blue part of the lines, suggesting that He I atoms are escaping from the atmosphere of WASP-107b. We interpret the time-series absorption spectra using the 3D EVE code. Our observations can be explained by combining an extended thermosphere that ﬁlls half of the Roche lobe and a large exospheric tail sustained by an escape rate of metastable helium of about 106 g s−1. In this scenario, however, the upper atmosphere needs to be subjected to a reduced photoionisation and radiation pressure from the star for the model to match the observations.
Conclusions. We conﬁrm the presence of helium in the atmosphere of WASP-107b at high conﬁdence. The helium feature is detected from space and from the ground. The ground-based high-resolution signal brings detailed information about the spatial and dynamical structure of the upper atmosphere, and simulations suggest that the He I signature of WASP-107b probes both its thermosphere and exosphere, establishing this signature as a robust probe of exoplanetary upper atmospheres. Surveys with NIR high-resolution spectrographs (e.g. CARMENES, the Spectromètre infrarouge (SPIRou), or the Near-Infrared Planet Searcher (NIRPS)) will deliver a statistical understanding of exoplanet thermospheres and exospheres through the helium triplet.},

	abstract = {Observational evidence for escaping exoplanet atmospheres has been obtained for a few exoplanets to date. It comes from strong transit signals detected in the ultraviolet, most notably in the wings of the hydrogen Lyα (Lyα) line. However, the core of the Lyα line is often heavily affected by interstellar absorption and geocoronal emission, limiting the information about the atmosphere that can be extracted from that part of the spectrum. Transit observations in atomic lines that are (a) sensitive enough to trace the rareﬁed gas in the planetary wind and (b) do not suffer from signiﬁcant extinction by the interstellar medium could enable more detailed observations, and thus provide better constraints on theoretical models of escaping atmospheres. The absorption line of a metastable state of helium at 10830Å could satisfy both of these conditions for some exoplanets. We develop a simple 1D model of escaping planetary atmospheres containing hydrogen and helium. We use it to calculate the density proﬁle of helium in the 23S metastable excited state and the expected in-transit absorption at 10830Å for two exoplanets known to have escaping atmospheres. Our results indicate that exoplanets similar to GJ436b and HD209458b should exhibit enhanced transit depths at 10830Å, with ∼8\% and ∼2\% excess absorption in the line core, respectively.},

	abstract = {Strong absorption signatures in the helium line at 1083 nm have recently been detected in transmission spectra of several close-in exoplanets. This absorption line originates from neutral helium atoms in an excited, metastable 23S state. The population of helium atoms in this excited state is governed by the spectral shape and intensity of the incident stellar radiation ﬁeld. We investigate what kind of stellar environments are most favorable for populating the metastable helium state in extended planetary atmospheres. Our results suggest that planets orbiting at close separations from late-type stars—particularly K-stars—are the most promising candidates for transit absorption signals at 1083 nm. This result is supported by observations, as all four exoplanets with currently reported helium detections orbit K-type stars. In general, conditions for exciting helium atoms become more favorable at closer orbital separations, and around stars with higher levels of extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) ﬂux, which ionizes the helium ground state, and lower levels of mid-ultraviolet (mid-UV) ﬂux, which ionizes the helium metastable state.},

	abstract = {Giant exoplanets orbiting close to their host stars have high temperatures because of the immense stellar irradiation which they receive. The extreme energy input leads to the expansion of the atmosphere and the escape of neutral hydrogen. A particularly intriguing case among the hot giant planets is KELT-9b -- an exoplanet orbiting very close to an early A-type star with the highest temperature ({\textasciitilde}4600 K at day-side) among all the exoplanets known so far. The atmospheric composition and dynamic of such a unique planet have been unknown. Here we report the first detection of an extended hot hydrogen atmosphere around KELT-9b. The detection was achieved by measuring the atomic hydrogen absorption during transit with the Balmer H\{{\textbackslash}alpha\} line, which is unusually strong mainly due to the high level of extreme-ultraviolet radiation from the star. We detected a significant wavelength shift of the H\{{\textbackslash}alpha\} absorption which is mostly attributed to the planetary orbital motion. The obtained transmission spectrum has a significant line contrast (1.15\% extra absorption at the H\{{\textbackslash}alpha\} line centre). The observation implies that the effective radius at the H\{{\textbackslash}alpha\} line centre is {\textasciitilde}1.64 times the size of the planetary radius, indicating the planet has a largely extended hydrogen envelope close to the size of the Roche lobe (1.91 Rplanet) and is probably undergoing dramatic atmosphere escape.},

	abstract = {The M dwarf GJ 436 hosts a transiting warm Neptune known to experience atmospheric escape. Previous observations revealed the presence of a giant hydrogen exosphere transiting the star for more than 5 h, and absorbing up to 56\% of the ﬂux in the blue wing of the stellar Lyman-α line of neutral hydrogen (H i Lyα). The unexpected size of this comet-like exosphere prevented observing the full transit of its tail. In this Letter, we present new Lyα observations of GJ 436 obtained with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) instrument onboard the Hubble Space Telescope. The stability of the Lyα line over six years allowed us to combine these new observations with archival data sets, substantially expanding the coverage of the exospheric transit. Hydrogen atoms in the tail of the exospheric cloud keep occulting the star for 10–25 h after the transit of the planet, remarkably conﬁrming a previous prediction based on 3D numerical simulations with the EVaporating Exoplanet code (EVE). This result strengthens the interpretation that the exosphere of GJ 436b is shaped by both radiative braking and charge exchanges with the stellar wind. We further report ﬂux decreases of 15 ± 2\% and 47 ± 10\% in the red wing of the Lyα line and in the line of ionised silicon (Si iii). Despite some temporal variability possibly linked with stellar activity, these two signals occur during the exospheric transit and could be of planetary origin. Follow-up observations will be required to assess the possibility that the redshifted Lyα and Si iii absorption signatures arise from interactions between the exospheric ﬂow and the magnetic ﬁeld of the star.},

	abstract = {Exoplanets orbiting close to their parent stars could lose some fraction of their atmospheres because of the extreme irradiation. Atmospheric mass loss primarily affects low-mass exoplanets, leading to suggest that hot rocky planets might have begun as Neptune-like, but subsequently lost all of their atmospheres; however, no confident measurements have hitherto been available. The signature of this loss could be observed in the ultraviolet spectrum, when the planet and its escaping atmosphere transit the star, giving rise to deeper and longer transit signatures than in the optical spectrum. Here we report that in the ultraviolet the Neptune-mass exoplanet GJ 436b (also known as Gliese 436b) has transit depths of 56.3 +/- 3.5\% (1 sigma), far beyond the 0.69\% optical transit depth. The ultraviolet transits repeatedly start {\textasciitilde}2 h before, and end {\textgreater}3 h after the {\textasciitilde}1 h optical transit, which is substantially different from one previous claim (based on an inaccurate ephemeris). We infer from this that the planet is surrounded and trailed by a large exospheric cloud composed mainly of hydrogen atoms. We estimate a mass-loss rate in the range of {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}8-10{\textasciicircum}9 g/s, which today is far too small to deplete the atmosphere of a Neptune-like planet in the lifetime of the parent star, but would have been much greater in the past.},

The mass-loss rates scale as LX/a2 for X-ray driven evaporation, and as 1∗/2/a for EUV driven evaporation at early times, with mass-loss rates of the order of 1010–1014 g s−1. No exact scaling exists for the mass-loss rate with planet mass and planet radius; however, in general evaporation proceeds more rapidly for planets with lower densities and higher masses. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that in general the transition from X-ray driven to EUV driven evaporation occurs at lower X-ray luminosities for planets closer to their parent stars and for planets with lower densities.},

	abstract = {We highlight the importance of gaseous TiO and VO opacity on the highly irradiated close-in giant planets. The dayside atmospheres of these planets naturally fall into two classes that are somewhat analogous to the M- and L-type dwarfs. Those that are warm enough to have appreciable opacity due to TiO and VO gases we term ‘‘pM class’’ planets, and those that are cooler we term ‘‘pL class’’ planets. We calculate model atmospheres for these planets, including pressure-temperature proﬁles, spectra, and characteristic radiative time constants. We show that pM class planets have temperature inversions (hot stratospheres), appear ‘‘anomalously’’ bright in the mid-infrared secondary eclipse, and feature molecular bands in emission rather than absorption. From simple physical arguments, we show that they will have large day/night temperature contrasts and negligible phase shifts between orbital phase and thermal emission light curves, because radiative timescales are much shorter than possible dynamical timescales. The pL class planets absorb incident ﬂux deeper in the atmosphere where atmospheric dynamics will more readily redistribute absorbed energy. This will lead to cooler day sides, warmer night sides, and larger phase shifts in thermal emission light curves. The boundary between these classes (\$0.04Y0.05 AU from a Sun-like primary for solar composition) is particularly dependent on the incident ﬂux from the parent star, and less so on other factors. We apply these results to several planets and note that the eccentric transiting planets HD 147506b and HD 17156b alternate between the classes. Thermal emission in the optical from pM class planets is signiﬁcant redward of 400 nm, making these planets attractive targets for optical detection. The difference in the observed day/night contrast between   And b ( pM class) and HD 189733b (pL class) is naturally explained in this scenario.},

The two-stream approximation and correlated-k method are currently state-of-the-art approximations applied in both Earth and hot Jupiter GCM radiation schemes to facilitate the rapid calculation of ﬂuxes and heating rates. Their accuracy have been tested extensively for Earth-like conditions, but veriﬁcation of the methods’ applicability to hot Jupiter-like conditions is lacking in the literature. We are adapting the UK Met Oﬃce GCM, the Uniﬁed Model (UM), for the study of hot Jupiters, and present in this work the adaptation of the Edwards-Slingo radiation scheme based on the two-stream approximation and the correlated-k method. We discuss the calculation of absorption coeﬃcients from high-temperature line lists and highlight the large uncertainty in the pressure-broadened line widths. We compare ﬂuxes and heating rates obtained with our adapted scheme to more accurate discrete ordinate (DO) line-by-line (LbL) calculations ignoring scattering eﬀects. We ﬁnd that, in most cases, errors stay below 10\% for both heating rates and ﬂuxes using ∼10 k-coeﬃcients in each band and a diﬀusivity factor D = 1.66. The two-stream approximation and the correlated-k method both contribute non-negligibly to the total error. We also ﬁnd that using band-averaged absorption coeﬃcients, which have previously been used in radiative-hydrodynamical simulations of a hot Jupiter, may yield errors of ∼100\%, and should thus be used with caution.},

We present an interpretation of observations of ten exoplanets, including best fit parameters and \${\textbackslash}chi{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$ maps. In agreement with previous works, we find a continuum from clear to hazy/cloudy atmospheres for this sample of hot Jupiters. The data for all the 10 planets are consistent with sub-solar to solar C/O ratio, 0.005 to 10 times solar metallicity and water rather than a methane dominated infrared spectra. We then explore the range of simulated atmospheric spectra for different exoplanets, based on characteristics such as temperature, metallicity, C/O-ratio, haziness and cloudiness. We find a transition value for the metallicity between 10 and 50 times solar, which leads to substantial changes in the transmission spectra. We also find a transition value of C/O ratio, from water to carbon species dominated infrared spectra, as found by previous works, revealing a temperature dependence of this transition point ranging from \${\textbackslash}sim\$0.56 to \${\textbackslash}sim\$1-1.3 for equilibrium temperatures from \${\textbackslash}sim\$900 to \${\textbackslash}sim\$2600 K.

	abstract = {In this work we investigate the impact of calculating non-equilibrium chemical abundances consistently with the temperature structure for the atmospheres of highly-irradiated, close-in gas giant exoplanets. Chemical kinetics models have been widely used in the literature to investigate the chemical compositions of hot Jupiter atmospheres which are expected to be driven away from chemical equilibrium via processes such as vertical mixing and photochemistry. All of these models have so far used pressure–temperature (P–T ) proﬁles as ﬁxed model input. This results in a decoupling of the chemistry from the radiative and thermal properties of the atmosphere, despite the fact that in nature they are intricately linked. We use a one-dimensional radiative-convective equilibrium model, ATMO, which includes a sophisticated chemistry scheme to calculate P–T proﬁles which are fully consistent with non-equilibrium chemical abundances, including vertical mixing and photochemistry. Our primary conclusion is that, in cases of strong chemical disequilibrium, consistent calculations can lead to diﬀerences in the P–T proﬁle of up to 100 K compared to the P–T proﬁle derived assuming chemical equilibrium. This temperature change can, in turn, have important consequences for the chemical abundances themselves as well as for the simulated emission spectra. In particular, we ﬁnd that performing the chemical kinetics calculation consistently can reduce the overall impact of non-equilibrium chemistry on the observable emission spectrum of hot Jupiters. Simulated observations derived from non-consistent models could thus yield the wrong interpretation. We show that this behaviour is due to the non-consistent models violating the energy budget balance of the atmosphere.},

	abstract = {The correlated-k method is frequently used to speed up radiation calculations in both one-dimensional and three-dimensional atmosphere models. An inherent diﬃculty with this method is how to treat overlapping absorption, i.e. absorption by more than one gas in a given spectral region. We have evaluated the applicability of three diﬀerent methods in hot Jupiter and brown dwarf atmosphere models, all of which have been previously applied within models in the literature: (i) random overlap, both with and without resorting and rebinning, (ii) equivalent extinction and (iii) pre-mixing of opacities, where (i) and (ii) combine k-coeﬃcients for diﬀerent gases to obtain k-coeﬃcients for a mixture of gases, while (iii) calculates k-coeﬃcients for a given mixture from the corresponding mixed line-by-line opacities. We ﬁnd that the random overlap method is the most accurate and ﬂexible of these treatments, and is fast enough to be used in one-dimensional models with resorting and rebinning. In three-dimensional models such as global circulation models (GCMs) it is too slow, however, and equivalent extinction can provide a speed-up of at least a factor of three with only a minor loss of accuracy while at the same time retaining the ﬂexibility gained by combining k-coeﬃcients computed for each gas individually. Pre-mixed opacities are signiﬁcantly less ﬂexible, and we also ﬁnd that particular care must be taken when using this method in order to to adequately resolve steep variations in composition at important chemical equilibrium boundaries. We use the random overlap method with resorting and rebinning in our one-dimensional atmosphere model and equivalent extinction in our GCM, which allows us to e.g. consistently treat the feedback of non-equilibrium chemistry on the total opacity and therefore the calculated P–T proﬁles in our models.},

However, the atmospheric properties inferred by retrieval techniques display a signiﬁcant anomaly: most retrieved temperatures are far colder than expected. In some cases, retrieved temperatures are {\textasciitilde}1000 K colder than Teq. Here, we provide an explanation for this conundrum. We demonstrate that erroneously cold temperatures result when 1D atmospheric models are applied to spectra of planets with differing morning–evening terminator compositions. Despite providing an acceptable ﬁt, 1D retrieval techniques artiﬁcially tune atmospheric parameters away from terminator-averaged properties. Retrieved temperature proﬁles are hundreds of degrees cooler and have weaker temperature gradients than reality. Retrieved abundances are mostly biased by {\textgreater}1s and sometimes by {\textgreater}3s, with the most extreme biases for ultra-hot Jupiters. When morning–evening compositional differences manifest for prominent opacity sources, H2O abundances retrieved by 1D models can be biased by over an order of magnitude. Finally, we demonstrate that these biases provide an explanation for the cold retrieved temperatures reported for WASP-17b and WASP-12b. To overcome biases associated with 1D atmospheric models, there is an urgent need to develop multidimensional retrieval techniques.},

The planet was observed in transit with Hubble STIS and WFC3 as part of the Hubble Panchromatic Comparative Exoplanet Treasury (PanCET) program, and we combine those data with warm {\textbackslash}textit\{Spitzer\} transit observations. We extract transit depths from each of the data sets, presenting the STIS transit spectrum (0.29--0.93{\textbackslash},\${\textbackslash}mu\$m) for the first time. We retrieve the transit spectrum both with a free-chemistry retrieval suite (AURA) and a complementary chemical equilibrium retrieval suite (PLATON) to constrain the atmospheric properties at the day-night terminator. Both methods provide an excellent fit to the observed spectrum. Both AURA and PLATON retrieve a metal-rich atmosphere for almost all model assumptions (most likely O/H ratio of \${\textbackslash}log\_\{10\}\{Z/Z\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\} = 1.46{\textasciicircum}\{+0.53\}\_\{-0.68\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}log\_\{10\}\{Z/Z\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\} = 2.33{\textasciicircum}\{+0.23\}\_\{-0.25\}\$, respectively); this is driven by a 4.9-\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ detection of H\$\_2\$O as well as evidence of gas absorption in the optical (\${\textgreater}\$2.7-\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ detection) due to Na, AlO and/or VO/TiO, though no individual species is strongly detected. Both retrievals determine the transit spectrum to be consistent with a clear atmosphere, with no evidence of haze or high-altitude clouds. Interior modeling constraints on the maximum atmospheric metallicity (\${\textbackslash}log\_\{10\}\{Z/Z\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\} {\textless} 1.7\$) favor the AURA results. The inferred elemental oxygen abundance suggests that HAT-P-41b has one of the most metal-rich atmospheres of any hot Jupiters known to date. Overall, the inferred high metallicity and high inflation make HAT-P-41b an interesting test case for planet formation theories.},

	abstract = {The G0V star HD166435 has been observed by the fiber-fed spectrograph ELODIE as one of the targets in the large extra-solar planet survey that we are conducting at the Observatory of Haute-Provence. We detected coherent, low-amplitude, radial-velocity variations with a period of 3.7987days, suggesting a possible close-in planetary companion. Subsequently, we initiated a series of high-precision photometric observations to search for possible planetary transits and an additional series of CaII H and K observations to measure the level of surface magnetic activity and to look for possible rotational modulation. Surprisingly, we found the star to be photometrically variable and magnetically active. A detailed study of the phase stability of the radial-velocity signal revealed that the radial-velocity variability remains coherent only for durations of about 30days. Analysis of the time variation of the spectroscopic line profiles using line bisectors revealed a correlation between radial velocity and line-bisector orientation. All of these observations, along with a one-quarter cycle phase shift between the photometric and the radial-velocity variationss, are well explained by the presence of dark photospheric spots on HD166435. We conclude that the radial-velocity variations are not due to gravitational interaction with an orbiting planet but, instead, originate from line-profile changes stemming from star spots on the surface of the star. The quasi-coherence of the radial-velocity signal over more than two years, which allowed a fair fit with a binary model, makes the stability of this star unusual among other active stars. It suggests a stable magnetic field orientation where spots are always generated at about the same location on the surface of the star.},

An essential collection of data and opinions for those charged with setting scientific and funding priorities. This three-volume set, The Future of Small Telescopes in the New Millennium details the essential roles that small telescopes should play in 21st century science and how their future productivity can be maximized. Over 70 experts from all corners of the international astronomical community have created a definitive reference on the present and future of "big science with small telescopes." Despite highly publicized closures of telescopes smaller than 4-m in aperture at national facilities and their omission from national science priority studies, the oft-lamented demise of the small telescope has been greatly exaggerated. In fact, the future of these workhorses of astronomy will be brighter than ever if creative steps are taken now. This three-volume set defines the essential roles that small telescopes should play in 21st century science and the ways in which a productive future for them can be realized. A wide cross-section of the astronomical community has contributed to a definitive assessment of the present and a vision for the future. Volume 2: The Telescopes We Use Small cost-effective optical-, radio- and space-based facilities face similar problems in scientific prioritization and funding. Volume 2 highlights how current small facilities are evolving to meet the scientific priorities and economical realities of the 21st century through standardization of instrumentation, use of off-the-shelf technology, specialization, optical improvements, new modes of scheduling, automation, and internet access. The Future of Small Telescopes in the New Millennium is a fundamental resource for those looking to undertake new projects with small telescopes, for those that are responsible for their operation, and for those called upon to help set scientific priorities for the coming decade.

To date, less than 20 exoplanets have been probed in this critical wavelength range (0.2-0.4 um). Here we use data from Hubble's newly implemented WFC3 UVIS G280 grism to probe the atmosphere of the hot Jupiter HAT-P-41b in the ultraviolet through optical in combination with observations at infrared wavelengths. We analyze and interpret HAT-P-41b's 0.2-5.0 um transmission spectrum using a broad range of methodologies including multiple treatments of data systematics as well as comparisons with atmospheric forward, cloud microphysical, and multiple atmospheric retrieval models. Although some analysis and interpretation methods favor the presence of clouds or potentially a combination of Na, VO, AlO, and CrH to explain the ultraviolet through optical portions of HAT-P-41b's transmission spectrum, we find that the presence of a significant H- opacity provides the most robust explanation. We obtain a constraint for the abundance of H-, log(H-) = -8.65 +/- 0.62 in HAT-P-41b's atmosphere, which is several orders of magnitude larger than predictions from equilibrium chemistry for a 1700 - 1950 K hot Jupiter. We show that a combination of photochemical and collisional processes on hot hydrogen-dominated exoplanets can readily supply the necessary amount of H- and suggest that such processes are at work in HAT-P-41b and many other hot Jupiter atmospheres.},

Added to this, the fact that the phase curve appears dominated by reflected starlight makes this close-in giant planet a unique study case. Here we investigate the information on coverage and optical properties of the planet clouds contained in the measured phase curve. We generate cloud maps of Kepler-7b and use a multiple-scattering approach to create synthetic phase curves, thus connecting postulated clouds with measurements. We show that optical phase curves can help constrain the composition and size of the cloud particles. Indeed, model fitting for Kepler-7b requires poorly absorbing particles that scatter with low-to-moderate anisotropic efficiency, conclusions consistent with condensates of silicates, perovskite, and silica of submicron radii. We also show that we are limited in our ability to pin down the extent and location of the clouds. These considerations are relevant to the interpretation of optical phase curves with general circulation models. Finally, we estimate that the spherical albedo of Kepler-7b over the Kepler passband is in the range 0.4–0.5.},

We find that although CO is predicted to be a major atmospheric constituent on hot Jupiters for all C/O ratios, other oxygen-bearing molecules like H2O and CO2 are much more abundant when C/O {\textless} 1, whereas CH4, HCN, and C2H2 gain significantly in abundance when C/O {\textgreater} 1. Disequilibrium processes tend to enhance the abundance of CH4, NH3, HCN, and C2H2 over a wide range of C/O ratios. We compare the results of our models with secondary-eclipse photometric data from the Spitzer Space Telescope and conclude that (1) disequilibrium models with C/O {\textasciitilde} 1 are consistent with spectra of WASP-12b, XO-1b, and CoRoT-2b, confirming the possible carbon-rich nature of these planets, (2) spectra from HD 189733b are consistent with C/O {\textasciitilde}{\textless} 1, but as the assumed metallicity is increased above solar, the required C/O ratio must increase toward 1 to prevent too much H2O absorption, (3) species like HCN can have a significant influence on spectral behavior in the 3.6 and 8.0 um Spitzer channels, potentially providing even more opacity than CH4 when C/O {\textgreater} 1, and (4) the very high CO2 abundance inferred for HD 189733b from near-infrared observations cannot be explained through equilibrium or disequilibrium chemistry in a H2-dominated atmosphere. We discuss possible formation mechanisms for carbon-rich hot Jupiters. The C/O ratio and bulk atmospheric metallicity provide important clues regarding the formation and evolution of the giant planets.},

While these objects are planets in every other sense, their atmospheres reach temperatures at low pressures comparable only to stellar atmospheres. In order to understand our a priori theoretical expectations for the nature of these objects, we self-consistently model a number of extreme hot Jupiter scenarios with the PHOENIX model atmosphere code. PHOENIX is well-tested on objects from cool brown dwarfs to expanding supernovae shells, and its expansive opacity database from the UV to far-IR make PHOENIX well-suited to understanding extremely irradiated hot Jupiters. We ﬁnd several fundamental differences between hot Jupiters at temperatures {\textgreater}2500 K and their cooler counterparts. First, absorption by atomic metals like Fe and Mg, molecules including SiO and metal hydrides, and continuous opacity sources like H−, all combined with the short-wavelength output of early-type host stars, result in strong thermal inversions, without the need for TiO or VO. Second, many molecular species, including H2O, TiO, and VO are thermally dissociated at pressures probed by transit and eclipse observations, potentially biasing retrieval algorithms that assume uniform vertical abundances. We discuss other interesting properties of these objects, as well as future prospects and predictions for observing and characterizing this unique class of astrophysical object, including the ﬁrst self-consistent model of the hottest known Jovian planet, KELT-9b.},

	abstract = {Spectra of exoplanet atmospheres provide us the opportunity to improve our understanding of these objects just as remote sensing in our own solar system has increased our understanding of the solar system bodies. The challenge is to quantitatively determine the range of temperatures and species abundances allowed by the data. This challenge is often difficult given the low information content of most exoplanet spectra which commonly leads to degeneracies in the interpretation. A variety of temperature and abundance retrieval approaches have been applied to exoplanet spectra, but no previous investigations have sought to compare these approaches. In this investigation we compare three different retrieval methods: Optimal Estimation, Differential Evolution Markov Chain Monte Carlo, and Bootstrap Monte Carlo. We call our suite of retrieval algorithms the Caltech Inverse Modeling and Retrieval Algorithms (CHIMERA). We discuss what we can expect in terms of uncertainties in abundances and temperatures given current observations as well as potential future observations and what conclusions can be drawn given those uncertainties. In general we find that the three approaches agree for high quality spectra expected to come from potential future spaceborne missions, but disagree for low quality spectra representative of current observations. We also show that the Gaussian posterior probability distribution assumption made in the Optimal Estimation approach is valid for high quality spectral data. We also discuss the implications of our models for the inferred C to O ratios of exoplanetary atmospheres, which of course are important for understanding formation environments. More specifically we show that in the observational limit of a few photometric points, the retrieved C/O is biased towards values near solar and near one simply due to the assumption of uninformative priors.},

These opacities are made available at R=1000 and R=10,000 over the 0.3--30 um range, and at R=375,000 in select near IR bands, making it possible to utilize PLATON for ground-based high resolution cross correlation studies. To demonstrate PLATON's new capabilities, we perform a retrieval on published HST and Spitzer transmission and emission spectra of the archetypal hot Jupiter HD 189733b. This is the first joint transit and secondary eclipse retrieval for this planet in the literature, as well as the most comprehensive set of both transit and eclipse data assembled for a retrieval to date. We find that these high signal-to-noise data are well-matched by atmosphere models with a C/O ratio of \$0.66\_\{-0.09\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.05\}\$ and a metallicity of \$12\_\{-5\}{\textasciicircum}\{+8\}\$ times solar where the terminator is dominated by extended nanometer-sized haze particles at optical wavelengths. These are among the smallest uncertainties reported to date for an exoplanet, demonstrating both the power and the limitations of HST and Spitzer exoplanet observations.},

Most of them are found orbiting bright A-F type stars, making them extremely suitable objects to study their atmospheres using high-resolution spectroscopy. Recent studies show a variety of atoms and molecules detected in the atmospheres of this type of planets. Here we present our analysis of the newly discovered ultra-hot Jupiter TOI-1431b/MASCARA-5b, using two transit observations with the HARPS-N spectrograph and one transit observation with the EXPRES spectrograph. Analysis of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect shows that the planet is in a polar orbit, with a projected obliquity \$ {\textbackslash}lambda = -155{\textasciicircum}\{+20\}\_\{-10\}\$ degrees. Combining the nights and applying both cross-correlation methods and transmission spectroscopy, we find no evidences of CaI, FeI, FeII, MgI, NaI, VI, TiO, VO or H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ in the atmosphere of the planet. Our most likely explanation for the lack of atmospheric features is the large surface gravity of the planet.},

A joint analysis of TESS, MuSCAT2, and LCOGT photometry, radial velocity measurements, and the spectral energy distribution of the host star reveals that TOI-1431b has a mass of \$M\_\{p\}=3.14\_\{-0.18\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.19\}\$ \${\textbackslash}rm\{M\_J\}\$ (\$1000{\textbackslash}pm60\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$), an inflated radius of \$R\_\{p\}=1.51{\textbackslash}pm0.06\$ \${\textbackslash}rm\{R\_J\}\$ (\$16.9\_\{-0.6\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.7\}\$ R\$\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$), and an orbital period of \$P=2.65022{\textbackslash}pm0.00001\$ d.

We report on eleven secondary-eclipse events at 3.6, 4.5, 3 x 5.8, 4 x 8.0, and 2 x 16 microns plus three primary-transit events at 8.0 microns. The eclipse depths from jointly-fit models at each wavelength are 0.040 +/- 0.003\% at 3.6 microns, 0.034 +/- 0.006\% at 4.5 microns, 0.044 +/- 0.010\% at 5.8 microns, 0.052 +/- 0.006\% at 8.0 microns, and 0.085 +/- 0.032\% at 16 microns. Multiple observations at the longer wavelengths improved eclipse-depth signal-to-noise ratios by up to a factor of two and improved estimates of the planet-to-star radius ratio (Rp/Rs = 0.0518 +/- 0.0006). We also identify no significant deviations from a circular orbit and, using this model, report an improved period of 2.8758916 +/- 0.0000014 days. Chemical-equilibrium models find no indication of a temperature inversion in the dayside atmosphere of HD 149026b. Our best-fit model favors large amounts of CO and CO2, moderate heat redistribution (f=0.5), and a strongly enhanced metallicity. These analyses use BiLinearly-Interpolated Subpixel Sensitivity (BLISS) mapping, a new technique to model two position-dependent systematics (intrapixel variability and pixelation) by mapping the pixel surface at high resolution. BLISS mapping outperforms previous methods in both speed and goodness of fit. We also present an orthogonalization technique for linearly-correlated parameters that accelerates the convergence of Markov chains that employ the Metropolis random walk sampler.

	abstract = {HAT-P-20b is a giant exoplanet that orbits a metal-rich star. The planet itself has a high total density, suggesting that it may also have a high metallicity in its atmosphere. We analyze two eclipses of the planet in each of the 3.6- and 4.5 micron bands of Warm Spitzer. These data exhibit intra-pixel detector sensitivity fluctuations that were resistant to traditional decorrelation methods. We have developed a simple, powerful, and radically different method to correct the intra-pixel effect for Warm Spitzer data, which we call pixel-level decorrelation (PLD). PLD corrects the intra-pixel effect very effectively, but without explicitly using - or even measuring - the fluctuations in the apparent position of the stellar image. We illustrate and validate PLD using synthetic and real data, and comparing the results to previous analyses. PLD can significantly reduce or eliminate red noise in Spitzer secondary eclipse photometry, even for eclipses that have proven to be intractable using other methods. Our successful PLD analysis of four HAT-P-20b eclipses shows a best-fit blackbody temperature of 1134 +/-29K, indicating inefficient longitudinal transfer of heat, but lacking evidence for strong molecular absorption. We find sufficient evidence for variability in the 4.5 micron band that the eclipses should be monitored at that wavelength by Spitzer, and this planet should be a high priority for JWST spectroscopy. All four eclipses occur about 35 minutes after orbital phase 0.5, indicating a slightly eccentric orbit. A joint fit of the eclipse and transit times with extant RV data yields e(cos\{omega\}) = 0.01352 (+0.00054, -0.00057), and establishes the small eccentricity of the orbit to high statistical confidence. Given the existence of a bound stellar companion, HAT-P-20b is another excellent candidate for orbital evolution via Kozai migration or other three-body mechanism.},

Multiple groups have analyzed the phase curves of WASP-43b with varying detrending techniques, each obtaining different results. In this work, we take another look at WASP-43b while exploring the degenerate relation between Bilinearly-Interpolated Subpixel Sensitivity (BLISS) mapping, point response function full width at half-maximum (PRF-FWHM) detrending, and phase curve parameters. We find that there is a strong correlation between the detrending parameters in the two models, and best fit phase curve amplitudes vary strongly when the data are temporally binned. To remove this degeneracy, we present a new Gaussian centroided intrapixel sensitivity map (hereafter fixed sensitivity map), generated using 3,712,830 exposures spanning 5 years, for a variety of aperture sizes at 4.5\${\textbackslash}mu m\$. We find evidence for time variability in the sensitivity at 3.6\${\textbackslash}mu m\$ and do not generate a visit-independent map for this channel. With the fixed 4.5 \${\textbackslash}mu m\$ intrapixel sensitivity map, the best fits for WASP-43b no longer vary strongly with bin size and PRF-FWHM detrending is no longer required to remove correlated noise. For data sets that do not fall completely within the sweet spot, temporal binning should not be used in the analysis of Spitzer phase curves. We confirm night side emission for WASP-43b with a disk integrated nightside temperature of 806 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 48 K at 4.5\${\textbackslash}mu m\$.

This indicates that planetary gravity plays a secondary role in the state of gaseous planetary atmospheres. We detect the presence of water vapour in all of the statistically detectable atmospheres, and we cannot rule out its presence in the atmospheres of the others. In addition, TiO and/or VO signatures are detected with 4σ conﬁdence in WASP-76 b, and they are most likely present in WASP-121 b.

We have computed full 3D LTE synthetic spectra based on 3D radiative hydrodynamic atmosphere models from the Stagger-grid in the ranges: Teﬀ from 4000 to 7000 K, log g from 1.5 to 5.0, and [Fe/H], from −4.0 to +0.5. From the resulting intensities, we derived coeﬃcients for the standard limb darkening laws considering a number of often-used photometric ﬁlters. Furthermore, we calculated theoretical transit light curves, in order to quantify the diﬀerences between predictions by the widely used 1D model atmosphere and our 3D models.
Results. The 3D models are often found to predict steeper darkening towards the limb compared to the 1D models, mainly due to the temperature stratiﬁcations and temperature gradients being diﬀerent in the 3D models compared to those predicted with 1D models based on the mixing length theory description of convective energy transport. The resulting diﬀerences in the transit light curves are rather small; however, these can be signiﬁcant for high-precision observations of extrasolar transits, and are able to lower the residuals from the ﬁts with 1D limb darkening proﬁles.
Conclusions. We advocate the use of the new limb darkening coeﬃcients provided for the standard four-parameter non-linear power law, which can ﬁt the limb darkening more accurately than other choices.},

	abstract = {We present an optical to near-infrared transmission spectrum of the hot Jupiter HAT-P-1b, based on Hubble Space Telescope observations, covering the spectral regime from 0.29 to 1.027 μm with Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS), which is coupled with a recent Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) transit (1.087 to 1.687 μm). We derive reﬁned physical parameters of the HAT-P-1 system, including an improved orbital ephemeris. The transmission spectrum shows a strong absorption signature shortward of 0.55 μm, with a strong blueward slope into the near-ultraviolet. We detect atmospheric sodium absorption at a 3.3σ signiﬁcance level, but ﬁnd no evidence for the potassium feature. The red data imply a marginally ﬂat spectrum with a tentative absorption enhancement at wavelength longer than ∼0.85 μm. The STIS and WFC3 spectra differ signiﬁcantly in absolute radius level (4.3 ± 1.6 pressure scaleheights), implying strong optical absorption in the atmosphere of HAT-P-1b. The optical to near-infrared difference cannot be explained by stellar activity, as simultaneous stellar activity monitoring of the G0V HAT-P-1b host star and its identical companion show no signiﬁcant activity that could explain the result. We compare the complete STIS and WFC3 transmission spectrum with theoretical atmospheric models which include haze, sodium and an extra optical absorber. We ﬁnd that both an optical absorber and a supersolar sodium to water abundance ratio might be a scenario explaining the HAT-P-1b observations. Our results suggest that strong optical absorbers may be a dominant atmospheric feature in some hot Jupiter exoplanets.},

We investigate constraints on atmospheric abundances of H\$\_2\$O, Na, and K, in a sample of transiting exoplanets using latest transmission spectra and new H\$\_2\$ broadened opacities of Na and K. Our sample of 19 exoplanets spans from cool mini-Neptunes to hot Jupiters, with equilibrium temperatures between \${\textbackslash}sim\$300 and 2700 K. Using homogeneous Bayesian retrievals we report atmospheric abundances of Na, K, and H\$\_2\$O, and their detection significances, confirming 6 planets with strong Na detections, 6 with K, and 14 with H\$\_2\$O. We find a mass-metallicity trend of increasing H\$\_2\$O abundances with decreasing mass, spanning generally substellar values for gas giants and stellar/superstellar for Neptunes and mini-Neptunes. However, the overall trend in H\$\_2\$O abundances, from mini-Neptunes to hot Jupiters, is significantly lower than the mass-metallicity relation for carbon in the solar system giant planets and similar predictions for exoplanets. On the other hand, the Na and K abundances for the gas giants are stellar or superstellar, consistent with each other, and generally consistent with the solar system metallicity trend. The H\$\_2\$O abundances in hot gas giants are likely due to low oxygen abundances relative to other elements rather than low overall metallicities, and provide new constraints on their formation mechanisms. The differing trends in the abundances of species argue against the use of chemical equilibrium models with metallicity as one free parameter in atmospheric retrievals, as different elements can be differently enhanced.},

As part of this analysis, we develop a new variant of pixel-level decorrelation that is effective at removing intrapixel sensitivity variations for long observations ({\textgreater}10 hr) where the position of the star can vary by a signiﬁcant fraction of a pixel. Using this algorithm, we measure eclipse depths, phase amplitudes, and phase offsets for both planets at 3.6 and 4.5 μm. We use a simple toy model to show that WASP-33b’s phase offset, albedo, and heat recirculation efﬁciency are largely similar to those of other hot Jupiters despite its very high irradiation. On the other hand, our ﬁts for HD 149026b prefer a very high albedo. We also compare our results to predictions from general circulation models, and we ﬁnd that while neither planet matches the models well, the discrepancies for HD 149026b are especially large. We speculate that this may be related to its high bulk metallicity, which could lead to enhanced atmospheric opacities and the formation of reﬂective cloud layers in localized regions of the atmosphere. We then place these two planets in a broader context by exploring relationships between the temperatures, albedos, heat transport efﬁciencies, and phase offsets of all planets with published thermal phase curves. We ﬁnd a striking relationship between phase offset and irradiation temperature: the former drops with increasing temperature until around 3400 K and rises thereafter. Although some aspects of this trend are mirrored in the circulation models, there are notable differences that provide important clues for future modeling efforts.},

	abstract = {Aerosols are common in the atmospheres of exoplanets across a wide swath of temperatures, masses, and ages. These aerosols strongly impact observations of transmitted, reflected, and emitted light from exoplanets, obfuscating our understanding of exoplanet thermal structure and composition. Knowing the dominant aerosol composition would facilitate interpretations of exoplanet observations and theoretical understanding of their atmospheres. A variety of compositions have been proposed, including metal oxides and sulphides, iron, chromium, sulphur, and hydrocarbons. However, the relative contributions of these species to exoplanet aerosol opacity is unknown. Here we show that the aerosol composition of giant exoplanets observed in transmission is dominated by silicates and hydrocarbons. By constraining an aerosol microphysics model with trends in giant exoplanet transmission spectra, we find that silicates dominate aerosol opacity above planetary equilibrium temperatures of 950 K due to low nucleation energy barriers and high elemental abundances, while hydrocarbon aerosols dominate below 950 K due to an increase in methane abundance. Our results are robust to variations in planet gravity and atmospheric metallicity within the range of most giant transiting exoplanets. We predict that spectral signatures of condensed silicates in the mid-infrared are most prominent for hot ({\textgreater}1600 K), low-gravity ({\textless}10 m s\${\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$) objects.},

Previous studies of the WFC3 transmission spectra of WASP-76 b found hints of titanium oxide (TiO) and vanadium oxide (VO) or non-grey clouds. Accounting for a fainter stellar companion to WASP-76, we reanalyse this data and show that removing the eﬀects of this background star changes the slope of the spectrum, resulting in these visible absorbers no longer being detected, eliminating the need for a non-grey cloud model to adequately ﬁt the data but maintaining the strong water feature previously seen. However, our analysis of the emission spectrum suggests the presence of TiO and an atmospheric thermal inversion, along with a signiﬁcant amount of water. Given the brightness of the host star and the size of the atmospheric features, WASP-76 b is an excellent target for further characterisation with HST, or with future facilities, to better understand the nature of its atmosphere, to conﬁrm the presence of TiO and to search for other optical absorbers.},

The measurements are based on the combined analysis of time-series spectroscopy obtained during two complete transits and two complete secondary eclipses of the planet. The observations were performed with the MMIRS instrument on the Magellan II telescope using the technique of multi-object spectroscopy with wide slits. We compare the transmission and emission data to theoretical models to constrain the composition and thermal structure of the planet's atmosphere. Our measured transmission spectrum exhibits a scatter that corresponds to 1.3 scale heights of the planet's atmosphere, which is consistent with the size of spectral features predicted by theoretical models for a clear atmosphere. We detected the secondary eclipses of the planet at significances ranging from 2.2 to 14.4 sigma. The secondary eclipse depths, and the significances of the detections increase towards longer wavelengths. Our measured emission spectrum is consistent with a 2250 K effectively isothermal 1-D model for the planet's dayside atmosphere. This model also matches previously published photometric measurements from the Spitzer Space Telescope and ground-based telescopes. These results demonstrate the important role that ground-based observations using multi-object spectroscopy can play in constraining the properties of exoplanet atmospheres, and they also emphasize the need for high-precision measurements based on observations of multiple transits and eclipses.},

The dataset spans three transits, two with a wavelength coverage between 2900 and 5700 Armstrong, and the third one between 5250 and 10300 Armstrong. From the one-dimensional, time dependent spectra we constructed white and chromatic light curves, the latter with typical integration band widths of {\textasciitilde}200 Armstrong. We computed the wavelength dependent planet-to-star radii ratios taking into consideration WASP-76's companion. The resulting transmission spectrum of WASP-76 b is dominated by a spectral slope of increasing opacity towards shorter wavelengths of amplitude of about three scale heights under the assumption of planetary equilibrium temperature. If the slope is caused by Rayleigh scattering, we derive a lower limit to the temperature of {\textasciitilde}870 K. Following-up on previous detection of atomic sodium derived from high resolution spectra, we re-analyzed HST data using narrower bands centered around sodium. From an atmospheric retrieval of this transmission spectrum, we report evidence of sodium at 2.9-sigma significance. In this case, the retrieved temperature at the top of the atmosphere (10-5 bar) is 2300 +412-392 K. We also find marginal evidence for titanium hydride.

	abstract = {We analyse emission spectra of WASP-12b from a partial phase curve observed over three epochs with the Hubble Space Telescope, covering eclipse, quadrature, and transit, respectively. As the 1.1-day period phase curve was only partially covered over three epochs, traditional methods to extract the planet ﬂux and instrument systematic errors cannot recover the thermal emission away from the secondary eclipse. To analyse this partial phase curve, we introduce a new method, which corrects for the wavelength-independent component of the systematic errors. Our new method removes the achromatic instrument and stellar variability, and uses the measured stellar spectrum in eclipse to then retrieve a relative planetary spectrum in wavelength at each phase. We are able to extract the emission spectrum of an exoplanet at quadrature outside of a phase curve for the ﬁrst time; we recover the quadrature spectrum of WASP-12b up to an additive constant. The dayside emission spectrum is extracted in a similar manner, and in both cases we are able to estimate the brightness temperature, albeit at a greatly reduced precision, because our method removes the absolute level of the spectra, and therefore relies on ﬁtting the slope of the emission spectrum instead of its amplitude. We estimate the brightness temperature from the dayside (Tday = 3186 ± 677 K) and from the quadrature spectrum (Tquad = 2124 ± 417 K) and combine them to constrain the energy budget of the planet. We compare our extracted relative spectra to global circulation models of this planet, which are generally found to be a good match. However, we do see tentative evidence of a steeper spectral slope in the measured dayside spectrum compared to our models. We ﬁnd that we cannot match this increased slope by increasing optical opacities in our models. We also ﬁnd that this spectral slope is unlikely to be explained by a non-equilibrium water abundance, as water advected from the nightside is quickly dissociated on the dayside. We present our technique for analysing partial or full phase curves from HST/WFC3 using common mode methods. Importantly, and unlike previous phase curve analyses, this technique does not assume a functional form for the planet’s emission with phase and does not require a full-orbit phase curve. The success of this technique relies upon stable pointing of the telescope between visits, with less than 0.1 pixels drift for example. This technique becomes powerful in the study of new regimes in exoplanetary systems such as for longer period planets, and is ideally suited for future observations with JWST and ARIEL.},

Assuming a physically plausible atmosphere, we find evidence that the presence of a number of molecules is consistent with the data, but the justification for inclusion of these opacity sources based on the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) is marginal. We also find the near-infrared primary eclipse light curve is consistent with small amounts of prolate distortion. As part of the calibration effort for these data, we conducted a detailed study of instrument systematics using 65 orbits of WFC3-IR grims observations. The instrument systematics are dominated by detector-related affects, which vary significantly depending on the detector readout mode. The 256x256 subarray observations of WASP 12 produced spectral measurements within 15\% of the photon-noise limit using a simple calibration approach. Residual systematics are estimated to be less than 70 parts per million.},

By using the nearby binary stars Kepler-13BC as a reference, we were able to create a differential light curve for Kepler-13A that had little of the systematics typically present in HST/WFC3 spectrophotometry. We measure a broadband (1.1–1.65 μm) eclipse depth of 734±28 ppm and are able to measure the emission spectrum of the planet at R≈50 with an average precision of 70 ppm. We ﬁnd that Kepler-13Ab possesses a noninverted, monotonically decreasing vertical temperature proﬁle. We exclude an isothermal proﬁle and an inverted proﬁle at more than 3σ. We also ﬁnd that the dayside emission of Kepler-13Ab appears generally similar to an isolated M7 brown dwarf at a similar effective temperature. Due to the relatively high mass and surface gravity of Kepler-13Ab, we suggest that the apparent lack of an inversion is due to cold-trap processes in the planet’s atmosphere. Using a toy model for where cold traps should inhibit inversions, as well as observations of other planets in this temperature range with measured emission spectra, we argue that with more detailed modeling and more observations we may be able to place useful constraints on the size of condensates on the daysides of hot Jupiters.},

	abstract = {Secondary eclipse observations of several of the hottest hot Jupiters show featureless, blackbody-like spectra or molecular emission features, which are consistent with thermal inversions being present in those atmospheres. Theory predicts a transition between warmer atmospheres with thermal inversions and cooler atmospheres without inversions, but the exact transition point is unknown. In order to further investigate this issue, we observed two secondary eclipses of the hot Jupiter HAT-P-7b with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFC3 instrument and combined these data with previous Spitzer and Kepler secondary eclipse observations. The HST and Spitzer data can be well fit by a blackbody with \$T=2692 {\textbackslash}pm 14\$ K, and the Kepler data point constrains the geometric albedo to \$A\_\{g\}=0.077 {\textbackslash}pm 0.006\$. We modeled these data with a 3D GCM and 1D self-consistent forward models. The 1D models indicate that the atmosphere has a thermal inversion, weak heat redistribution, and water dissociation that limits the range of pressures probed. This result suggests that WFC3 observations of HAT-P-7b and possibly some other ultra-hot Jupiters appear blackbody-like because they probe a region near the tropopause where the atmospheric temperature changes slowly with pressure. Additionally, the 1D models constrain the atmospheric metallicity (\$[{\textbackslash}text\{M/H\}]=-0.87{\textasciicircum}\{+0.38\}\_\{-0.34\}\$) and the carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O \${\textless}1\$ at 99 \% confidence). The solar composition 3D GCM matches the Spitzer data but generally underpredicts the flux in the WFC3 bandpass and cannot reproduce its featureless shape. This discrepancy could be explained by high atmospheric drag or nightside clouds, and may be better understood through further observation with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).},

Ultra-hot Jupiters are amenable to characterization due to their high temperatures, inﬂated radii, and short periods, but their atmospheres are atypical for planets in that the photosphere possesses large concentrations of atoms and ions relative to molecules. Here we evaluate how the atmospheres of these planets respond to irradiation by stars of different spectral type. We ﬁnd that ultra-hot Jupiters exhibit temperature inversions that are sensitive to the spectral type of the host star. The slope and temperature range across the inversion both increase as the host star effective temperature increases due to enhanced absorption at short wavelengths and low pressures. The steep temperature inversions in ultra-hot Jupiters around hot stars result in increased thermal dissociation and ionization compared to similar planets around cooler stars. The resulting increase in H− opacity leads to a transit spectrum that has muted absorption features. The emission spectrum, however, exhibits a large contrast in brightness temperature, a signature that will be detectable with both secondary eclipse observations and high-dispersion spectroscopy. We also ﬁnd that the departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium in the stellar atmosphere can affect the degree of heating caused by atomic metals in the planet’s upper atmosphere. Additionally, we further quantify the signiﬁcance of heating by different opacity sources in ultra-hot Jupiter atmospheres.},

	abstract = {We have developed an open-source, modular pipeline for the analysis of Spitzer/IRAC channel 1 and 2 time series photometry, incorporating some of the most popular decorrelation methods. We applied this pipeline to new phase curve observations of ultra-hot Jupiters MASCARA-1b and KELT-16b, and we have performed the first comprehensive reanalysis of 15 previously published phase curves. We find that MASCARA-1b and KELT-16b have phase offsets of \$1{\textasciicircum}\{+12\}\_\{-11\}{\textasciitilde}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$W and \$30{\textasciicircum}\{+13\}\_\{-13\}{\textasciitilde}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$W, dayside temperatures of \$3017{\textasciicircum}\{+92\}\_\{-90\}\$ K and \$3030{\textasciicircum}\{+150\}\_\{-140\}\$ K, and nightside temperatures of \$1260{\textasciicircum}\{+400\}\_\{-360\}\$ K and \$1520{\textasciicircum}\{+410\}\_\{-360\}\$ K, respectively. The Bond albedos of KELT-16b and MASCARA-1b are poorly constrained but are consistent with zero, and both planets show minimal recirculation. We confirm a strong correlation between dayside and irradiation temperatures, a shallow dependency of nightside temperature on irradiation temperature, and a correlation between Bond albedo and planetary surface gravity. We also find correlations between phase curve amplitude, orbital period, and phase offset consistent with previous predictions. In addition, while our different decorrelation models often retrieve similar parameters, significant differences occasionally arise between our models, as well as between our preferred model and the literature values. Nevertheless, our preferred models are consistent with published phase offsets to within \$1{\textbackslash}pm16\$ degrees (\$0.6{\textbackslash}pm2.5\$ sigma), and phase curve amplitudes are on average reproduced to within \$0.02{\textbackslash}pm0.19\$ (\$0.27{\textbackslash}pm4.9\$ sigma). Finally, we find that BLISS performs best in most cases, but not all; we therefore recommend future phase curve analyses consider a wide range of detector models to ensure an optimal fit and to assess the dependence of phase curve parameters on the decorrelation model used.},

Our follow-up radial velocity measurements indicate a variability of semiamplitude K = 71 m/s, implying a planet mass of 0.44 Mjup. By fitting the spectral energy distribution of the white dwarf we derive a total age of 4.08 (+1.21 -0.53) Gyr for the system.

We review in detail the theory of atmospheric chemistry in all classes of exoplanets discovered to date, from highly irradiated gas giants, ice giants, and super-Earths, to directly imaged giant planets at large orbital separations. We then review the observational detections of chemical species in exoplanetary atmospheres of these various types using different methods, including transit spectroscopy, doppler spectroscopy, and direct imaging.

The thousands of exoplanets discovered over the past decade have most recently been supplemented by discoveries of potentially habitable planets around nearby low-mass stars. Currently, the field is rapidly progressing towards detailed spectroscopic observations to characterise the atmospheres of these planets. While various surveys from space and ground are expected to detect numerous more exoplanets orbiting nearby stars, the imminent launch of JWST along with large ground-based facilities are expected to revolutionise exoplanetary spectroscopy. Such observations, combined with detailed theoretical models and inverse methods, provide valuable insights into a wide range of physical processes and chemical compositions in exoplanetary atmospheres. Depending on the planetary properties, the knowledge of atmospheric compositions can also place important constraints on planetary formation and migration mechanisms, geophysical processes, and, ultimately, biosignatures. In the present review, we will discuss the modern and future landscape of this frontier area of exoplanetary atmospheres. We will start with a brief review of the area, emphasising the key insights gained from different observational methods and theoretical studies.

	abstract = {The elemental compositions of planet hosting stars serve as proxies for the primordial compositions of the protoplanetary disks within which the planets form. The temperature profile of the disk governs the condensation fronts of various compounds, and although these chemically distinct regions migrate and mix during the disk lifetime, they can still leave an imprint on the compositions of the forming planets. Observable atmospheric compositions of hot Jupiters when compared against their host stars could potentially constrain their formation and migration processes. We compared the measured planetary and stellar abundances of carbon and oxygen for ten systems with hot Jupiters. If the planets formed by core accretion with significant planetesimal accretion and migrated through the disk, the hot Jupiter atmospheres should be substantially super-stellar in O/H and sub-stellar in C/O. On the contrary, however, we find that currently reported abundances of hot Jupiters have generally super-stellar C/O ratios, though present uncertainties on the reported O/H and C/O ratios are too large to reach a firm conclusion. In one case however, HD 209458b, the elevated C/O and depleted O/H of the planet compared to the host star is significant enough to suggest an origin far beyond the ice line, with predominantly gas accretion, and subsequent disk-free migration. Improved measurements from the James Webb Space Telescope will enable more precise measurements for more hot Jupiters and we predict, based on the current marginal trend, that a sizable fraction of hot Jupiters will show enrichment of C/O and lower O/H than their hosts, similar to HD 209458b.},

	abstract = {The Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) near-IR channel is extensively used in time-resolved observations, especially for transiting exoplanet spectroscopy as well as brown dwarf and directly imaged exoplanet rotational phase mapping. The ramp effect is the dominant source of systematics in the WFC3 for time-resolved observations, which limits its photometric precision. Current mitigation strategies are based on empirical fits and require additional orbits to help the telescope reach a thermal equilibrium. We show that the ramp-effect profiles can be explained and corrected with high fidelity using charge trapping theories. We also present a model for this process that can be used to predict and to correct charge trap systematics. Our model is based on a very small number of parameters that are intrinsic to the detector. We find that these parameters are very stable between the different data sets, and we provide best-fit values. Our model is tested with more than 120 orbits (∼40 visits) of WFC3 observations and is proved to be able to provide near photon noise limited corrections for observations made with both staring and scanning modes of transiting exoplanets as well as for starting-mode observations of brown dwarfs. After our model correction, the light curve of the first orbit in each visit has the same photometric precision as subsequent orbits, so data from the first orbit no longer need to be discarded. Near-IR arrays with the same physical characteristics (e.g., JWST/NIRCam) may also benefit from the extension of this model if similar systematic profiles are observed.},

The extreme irradiation levels these atmospheres experience causes them to undergo hydrodynamic atmospheric escape. Ongoing atmospheric escape has been observed to be occurring in a few nearby exoplanet systems through transit spectroscopy both for hot Jupiters and lower-mass super-Earths/mini-Neptunes. Detailed hydrodynamic calculations that incorporate radiative transfer and ionization chemistry are now common in one-dimensional models, and multi-dimensional calculations that incorporate magnetic-fields and interactions with the interstellar environment are cutting edge. However, there remains very limited comparison between simulations and observations. While hot Jupiters experience atmospheric escape, the mass-loss rates are not high enough to affect their evolution. However, for lower mass planets atmospheric escape drives and controls their evolution, sculpting the exoplanet population we observe today.},

	abstract = {A new piece of evidence supporting the photoevaporation-driven evolution model for low-mass, close-in exoplanets was recently presented by the California–Kepler Survey. The radius distribution of the Kepler planets is shown to be bimodal, with a “valley” separating two peaks at 1.3 and 2.6 R ⊕. Such an “evaporation valley” had been predicted by numerical models previously. Here, we develop a minimal model to demonstrate that this valley results from the following fact: the timescale for envelope erosion is the longest for those planets with hydrogen/helium-rich envelopes that, while only a few percent in weight, double its radius. The timescale falls for envelopes lighter than this because the planet’s radius remains largely constant for tenuous envelopes. The timescale also drops for heavier envelopes because the planet swells up faster than the addition of envelope mass. Photoevaporation therefore herds planets into either bare cores (∼1.3 R ⊕), or those with double the core’s radius (∼2.6 R ⊕). This process mostly occurs during the first 100 Myr when the stars’ high-energy fluxes are high and nearly constant. The observed radius distribution further requires the Kepler planets to be clustered around 3 M ⊕ in mass, born with H/He envelopes more than a few percent in mass, and that their cores are similar to the Earth in composition. Such envelopes must have been accreted before the dispersal of the gas disks, while the core composition indicates formation inside the ice line. Lastly, the photoevaporation model fails to account for bare planets beyond ∼30–60 days; if these planets are abundant, they may point to a significant second channel for planet formation, resembling the solar system terrestrial planets.},

	abstract = {We perform modeling investigations to aid in understanding the atmospheres and composition of small planets of {\textasciitilde}2-4 Earth radii, which are now known to be common in our galaxy. GJ 1214b is a well studied example whose atmospheric transmission spectrum has been observed by many investigators. Here we take a step back from GJ 1214b to investigate the role that planetary mass, composition, and temperature play in impacting the transmission spectra of these low-mass low-density (LMLD) planets. Under the assumption that these planets accrete modest hydrogen-dominated atmospheres and planetesimals, we use population synthesis models to show that predicted metal enrichments of the H/He envelope are high, with metal mass fraction Z\_env values commonly 0.6 to 0.9, or {\textasciitilde}100 to 400+ times solar. The high mean molecular weight of such atmospheres ({\textbackslash}mu {\textasciitilde} 5-12) would naturally help to flatten the transmission spectrum of most LMLD planets. The high metal abundance would also provide significant condensible material for cloud formation. It is known that the H/He abundance in Uranus and Neptune decreases with depth, and we show that atmospheric evaporation of LMLD planets could expose atmospheric layers with gradually higher Z\_env. However, values of Z\_env close to solar composition can also arise, so diversity should be expected. Photochemically produced hazes, potentially due to methane photolysis, are another possibility for obscuring transmission spectra. Such hazes may not form above T\_eq of {\textasciitilde}800-1100 K, which is testable if such warm, otherwise low mean molecular weight atmospheres are stable against atmospheric evaporation. We find that available transmission data are consistent with relatively high mean molecular weight atmospheres for GJ 1214b and "warm Neptune" GJ 436b. We examine future prospects for characterizing GJ 1214b with Hubble and the James Webb Space Telescope.},

We use the confirmation of these planets around relatively massive stars as an opportunity to explore the occurrence rate of hot Jupiters as a function of stellar mass. We define a sample of 47,126 main-sequence stars brighter than Tmag=10 that yields 31 giant planet candidates, including 18 confirmed planets, 3 candidates, and 10 false positives. We find a net hot Jupiter occurrence rate of 0.41+/-0.10 \% within this sample, consistent with the rate measured by Kepler for FGK stars. When divided into stellar mass bins, we find the occurrence rate to be 0.71+/-0.31\% for G stars, 0.43+/-0.15\% for F stars, and 0.26+/-0.11\% for A stars.

We have undertaken HEARTS, a spectroscopic survey of exoplanet upper atmospheres, to perform a comparative study of hot gas giants and determine how stellar irradiation affect them. Here, we report on the first HEARTS observations of the hot Saturn-mass planet WASP-49b. We observed the planet with the HARPS high-resolution spectrograph at ESO 3.6m telescope. We collected 126 spectra of WASP-49, covering three transits of WASP-49b. We analyzed and modeled the planet transit spectrum, while paying particular attention to the treatment of potentially spurious signals of stellar origin. We spectrally resolve the Na I D lines in the planet atmosphere and show that these signatures are unlikely to arise from stellar contamination. The large contrasts of \$2.0{\textbackslash}pm0.5{\textbackslash}\%\$ (D\$\_2\$) and \$1.8{\textbackslash}pm0.7{\textbackslash}\%\$ (D\$\_1\$) require the presence of hot neutral sodium (\$2,950{\textasciicircum}\{+400\}\_\{-500\}\$ K) at high altitudes (\${\textbackslash}sim\$1.5 planet radius or \${\textbackslash}sim\$45,000 km). From estimating the cloudiness index of WASP-49b, we determine its atmosphere to be cloud free at the altitudes probed by the sodium lines. WASP-49b is close to the border of the evaporation desert and exhibits an enhanced thermospheric signature with respect to a farther-away planet such as HD 189733b.},

	abstract = {High-resolution spectroscopy (R ≥ 25,000) has recently emerged as one of the leading methods for detecting atomic and molecular species in the atmospheres of exoplanets. However, it has so far been lacking a robust method for extracting quantitative constraints on the temperature structure and molecular/atomic abundances. In this work, we present a novel Bayesian atmospheric retrieval framework applicable to high-resolution cross-correlation spectroscopy (HRCCS) that relies on the cross-correlation between data and models to extract the planetary spectral signal. We successfully test the framework on simulated data and show that it can correctly determine Bayesian credibility intervals on atmospheric temperatures and abundances, allowing for a quantitative exploration of the inherent degeneracies. Furthermore, our new framework permits us to trivially combine and explore the synergies between HRCCS and low-resolution spectroscopy to maximally leverage the information contained within each. This framework also allows us to quantitatively assess the impact of molecular line opacities at high resolution. We apply the framework to VLT CRIRES K-band spectra of HD 209458 b and HD 189733 b and retrieve abundant carbon monoxide but subsolar abundances for water, which are largely invariant under different model assumptions. This confirms previous analysis of these data sets, but is possibly at odds with detections of H2O at different wavelengths and spectral resolutions. The framework presented here is the first step toward a true synergy between space observatories and ground-based high-resolution observations.},

Daysides are predicted to be cloud-free, dominated by atomic species6 and much hotter than nightsides5,7,8. Atoms are expected to recombine into molecules over the nightside9, resulting in different day and night chemistries. Although metallic elements and a large temperature contrast have been observed10–14, no chemical gradient has been measured across the surface of such an exoplanet. Different atmospheric chemistry between the day-to-night (‘evening’) and night-to-day (‘morning’) terminators could, however, be revealed as an asymmetric absorption signature during transit4,7,15. Here we report the detection of an asymmetric atmospheric signature in the ultrahot exoplanet WASP-76b. We spectrally and temporally resolve this signature using a combination of high-dispersion spectroscopy with a large photon-collecting area. The absorption signal, attributed to neutral iron, is blueshifted by −11 ± 0.7 kilometres per second on the trailing limb, which can be explained by a combination of planetary rotation and wind blowing from the hot dayside16. In contrast, no signal arises from the nightside close to the morning terminator, showing that atomic iron is not absorbing starlight there. We conclude that iron must therefore condense during its journey across the nightside.},

	abstract = {The spectrum of an exoplanet reveals the physical, chemical, and biological processes that have shaped its history and govern its future. However, observations of exoplanet spectra are complicated by the overwhelming glare of their host stars. This review chapter focuses on high resolution spectroscopy (HRS; R=25,000-100,000), which helps to disentangle and isolate the exoplanet's spectrum. At high spectral resolution, molecular features are resolved into a dense forest of individual lines in a pattern that is unique for a given molecule. For close-in planets, the spectral lines undergo large Doppler shifts during the planet's orbit, while the host star and Earth's spectral features remain essentially stationary, enabling a velocity separation of the planet. For slower-moving, wide-orbit planets, HRS aided by high contrast imaging instead isolates their spectra using their spatial separation. The lines in the exoplanet spectrum are detected by comparing them with high resolution spectra from atmospheric modelling codes; essentially a form of fingerprinting for exoplanet atmospheres. This measures the planet's orbital velocity, and helps define its true mass and orbital inclination. Consequently, HRS can detect both transiting and non-transiting planets. It also simultaneously characterizes the planet's atmosphere due to its sensitivity to the depth, shape, and position of the planet's spectral lines. These are altered by the planet's atmospheric composition, structure, clouds, and dynamics, including day-to-night winds and its rotation period. This chapter describes the HRS technique in detail, highlighting its successes in exoplanet detection and characterization, and concludes with the future prospects of using HRS to identify biomarkers on nearby rocky worlds, and map features in the atmospheres of giant exoplanets.},

	abstract = {Context: KELT-9 b exemplifies a newly emerging class of short-period gaseous exoplanets that tend to orbit hot, early type stars - termed ultra-hot Jupiters. The severe stellar irradiation heats their atmospheres to temperatures of \${\textbackslash}sim 4,000\$ K, similar to the photospheres of dwarf stars. Due to the absence of aerosols and complex molecular chemistry at such temperatures, these planets offer the potential of detailed chemical characterisation through transit and day-side spectroscopy. Studies of their chemical inventories may provide crucial constraints on their formation process and evolution history. Aims: To search the optical transmission spectrum of KELT-9 b for absorption lines by metals using the cross-correlation technique. Methods: We analyse 2 transits observed with the HARPS-N spectrograph. We use an isothermal equilibrium chemistry model to predict the transmission spectrum for each of the neutral and singly-ionized atoms with atomic numbers between 3 and 78. Of these, we identify the elements that are expected to have spectral lines in the visible wavelength range and use those as cross-correlation templates. Results: We detect absorption of Na I, Cr II, Sc II and Y II, and confirm previous detections of Mg I, Fe I, Fe II and Ti II. In addition, we find evidence of Ca I, Cr I, Co I, and Sr II that will require further observations to verify. The detected absorption lines are significantly deeper than model predictions, suggesting that material is transported to higher altitudes where the density is enhanced compared to a hydrostatic profile. There appears to be no significant blue-shift of the absorption spectrum due to a net day-to-night side wind. In particular, the strong Fe II feature is shifted by \$0.18 {\textbackslash}pm 0.27\$ km{\textasciitilde}s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, consistent with zero. Using the orbital velocity of the planet we revise the steller and planetary masses and radii.},

Searches for helium, however, have hitherto been unsuccessful2. Here we report observations of helium on an exoplanet, at a confidence level of 4.5 standard deviations. We measured the near-infrared transmission spectrum of the warm gas giant3 WASP-107b and identified the narrow absorption feature of excited metastable helium at 10,833 angstroms. The amplitude of the feature, in transit depth, is 0.049 ± 0.011 per cent in a bandpass of 98 angstroms, which is more than five times greater than what could be caused by nominal stellar chromospheric activity. This large absorption signal suggests that WASP-107b has an extended atmosphere that is eroding at a total rate of 1010 to 3 × 1011 grams per second (0.1–4 per cent of its total mass per billion years), and may have a comet-like tail of gas shaped by radiation pressure.},

Time-series spectra during two transit events were used to measure the transmission spectra between 2280 and 3070 Å at a resolution of 30,000. Using HST data from 61 Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph visits, we show that data from HST’s Pointing Control System can be used to decorrelate the instrument systematic errors (jitter decorrelation), which we used to fit the WASP-121b light curves. The NUV spectra show very strong absorption features, with the NUV white light curve found to be larger than the average optical and near-infrared value at 6σ confidence. We identify and spectrally resolve absorption from the Mg ii doublet in the planetary exosphere at a 5.9σ confidence level. The Mg ii doublet is observed to reach altitudes of R pl/R star = 0.284 ± 0.037 for the 2796 Å line and 0.242 ± 0.0431 for the 2804 Å line, which exceeds the Roche lobe size as viewed in transit geometry (R eqRL/R star = 0.158). We also detect and resolve strong features of the Fe ii UV1 and UV2 multiplets, and observe the lines reaching altitudes of R pl/R star ≈ 0.3. At these high altitudes, the atmospheric Mg ii and Fe ii gas is not gravitationally bound to the planet, and these ionized species may be hydrodynamically escaping or could be magnetically confined. Refractory Mg and Fe atoms at high altitudes also indicate that these species are not trapped into condensate clouds at depth, which places constraints on the deep interior temperature.},

Recently this feature was detected for the first time using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFC3 observations of the hot Jupiter WASP-107b. We use similar HST/WFC3 observations to detect helium in the atmosphere of the hot Neptune HAT-P-11b at the 4σ confidence level. We compare our observations to a grid of 1D models of hydrodynamic escape to constrain the thermospheric temperatures and mass loss rate. We find that our data are best fit by models with high mass loss rates of g s−1. Although we do not detect the planetary wind directly, our data are consistent with the prediction that HAT-P-11b is experiencing hydrodynamic atmospheric escape. Nevertheless, the mass loss rate is low enough that the planet has only lost up to a few percent of its mass over its history, leaving its bulk composition largely unaffected. This matches the expectation from population statistics, which indicate that close-in planets with radii greater than 2 R ⊕ form and retain H/He-dominated atmospheres. We also confirm the independent detection of helium in HAT-P-11b obtained with the CARMENES instrument, making this the first exoplanet with the detection of the same signature of photoevaporation from both ground- and space-based facilities.},

The precise HST transmission spectrum notably reveals a low-amplitude water feature with an unusual shape. Based on free-retrieval analyses with varying molecular abundances, we find strong evidence for water absorption. Depending on model assumptions, we also find tentative evidence for other absorbers (HCN, TiO, and AlO). The retrieved water abundance is generally ≲0.1× solar (0.001–0.7× solar over a range of model assumptions), several orders of magnitude lower than expected from planet formation models based on the solar system metallicity trend. We also consider chemical-equilibrium and self-consistent 1D radiative-convective equilibrium model fits and find that they, too, prefer low metallicities ([M/H] ≲ −2, consistent with the free-retrieval results). However, all of the retrievals should be interpreted with some caution because they either require additional absorbers that are far out of chemical equilibrium to explain the shape of the spectrum or are simply poor fits to the data. Finally, we find that the Spitzer secondary eclipse is indicative of full heat redistribution from KELT-11b’s dayside to nightside, assuming a clear dayside. These potentially unusual results for KELT-11b’s composition are suggestive of new challenges on the horizon for atmosphere and formation models in the face of increasingly precise measurements of exoplanet spectra.},

We find that WASP-62b has a slightly eccentric orbit e cos(omega) = 0.00614+/- 0.00064, and we confirm the eccentricity of HAT-P-13b and WASP-14b. The remainder are individually consistent with circular orbits, but we find statistical evidence for eccentricity increasing with orbital period in our range from 1 to 5 days. Our day-side brightness temperatures for the planets yield information on albedo and heat redistribution, following Cowan and Agol (2011). Planets having maximum day side temperatures exceeding {\textasciitilde} 2200K are consistent with zero albedo and distribution of stellar irradiance uniformly over the day-side hemisphere. Our most intriguing result is that we detect a systematic difference between the emergent spectra of these hot Jupiters as compared to blackbodies. The ratio of observed brightness temperatures, Tb(4.5)/Tb(3.6), increases with equilibrium temperature by 100 +/- 24 parts-per-million per Kelvin, over the entire temperature range in our sample (800K to 2500K). No existing model predicts this trend over such a large range of temperature. We suggest that this may be due to a structural difference in the atmospheric temperature profile between the real planetary atmospheres as compared to models.},

	abstract = {A key legacy of the recently launched the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission will be to provide the astronomical community with many of the best transiting exoplanet targets for atmospheric characterization. However, time is of the essence to take full advantage of this opportunity. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), although delayed, will still complete its nominal five year mission on a timeline that motivates rapid identification, confirmation, and mass measurement of the top atmospheric characterization targets from TESS. Beyond JWST, future dedicated missions for atmospheric studies such as the Atmospheric Remote-sensing Infrared Exoplanet Large-survey (ARIEL) require the discovery and confirmation of several hundred additional sub-Jovian size planets (Rp {\textless} 10 R⊕) orbiting bright stars, beyond those known today, to ensure a successful statistical census of exoplanet atmospheres. Ground-based extremely large telescopes (ELTs) will also contribute to surveying the atmospheres of the transiting planets discovered by TESS. Here we present a set of two straightforward analytic metrics, quantifying the expected signal-to-noise in transmission and thermal emission spectroscopy for a given planet, that will allow the top atmospheric characterization targets to be readily identified among the TESS planet candidates. Targets that meet our proposed threshold values for these metrics would be encouraged for rapid follow-up and confirmation via radial velocity mass measurements. Based on the catalog of simulated TESS detections by Sullivan et al., we determine appropriate cutoff values of the metrics, such that the TESS mission will ultimately yield a sample of ∼300 high-quality atmospheric characterization targets across a range of planet size bins, extending down to Earth-size, potentially habitable worlds.},

	abstract = {The super-Neptune exoplanet WASP-107b is an exciting target for atmosphere characterization. It has an unusually large atmospheric scale height and a small, bright host star, raising the possibility of precise constraints on its current nature and formation history. We report the first atmospheric study of WASP-107b, a Hubble Space Telescope (HST) measurement of its near-infrared transmission spectrum. We determined the planet’s composition with two techniques: atmospheric retrieval based on the transmission spectrum and interior structure modeling based on the observed mass and radius. The interior structure models set a 3σ upper limit on the atmospheric metallicity of 30× solar. The transmission spectrum shows strong evidence for water absorption (6.5σ confidence), and the retrieved water abundance is consistent with expectations for a solar abundance pattern. The inferred carbon-to-oxygen ratio is subsolar at 2.7σ confidence, which we attribute to possible methane depletion in the atmosphere. The spectral features are smaller than predicted for a cloud-free composition, crossing less than one scale height. A thick condensate layer at high altitudes (0.1–3 mbar) is needed to match the observations. We find that physically motivated cloud models with moderate sedimentation efficiency (f sed = 0.3) or hazes with a particle size of 0.3 μm reproduce the observed spectral feature amplitude. Taken together, these findings serve as an illustration of the diversity and complexity of exoplanet atmospheres. The community can look forward to more such results with the high precision and wide spectral coverage afforded by future observing facilities.},

Theoretical models predict that these planets are more vulnerable to atmospheric loss than their counterparts orbiting Sun-like stars3–6. To determine whether a thick atmosphere has survived on a small planet, one approach is to search for signatures of atmospheric heat redistribution in its thermal phase curve7–10. Previous phase curve observations of the super-Earth 55 Cancri e (1.9 Earth radii) showed that its peak brightness is offset from the substellar point (latitude and longitude of 0 degrees)—possibly indicative of atmospheric circulation11. Here we report a phase curve measurement for the smaller, cooler exoplanet LHS 3844b, a 1.3-Earth-radii world in an 11-hour orbit around the small nearby star LHS 3844. The observed phase variation is symmetric and has a large amplitude, implying a dayside brightness temperature of 1,040 ± 40 kelvin and a nightside temperature consistent with zero kelvin (at one standard deviation). Thick atmospheres with surface pressures above 10 bar are ruled out by the data (at three standard deviations), and less-massive atmospheres are susceptible to erosion by stellar wind. The data are well fitted by a bare-rock model with a low Bond albedo (lower than 0.2 at two standard deviations). These results support theoretical predictions that hot terrestrial planets orbiting small stars may not retain substantial atmospheres.},

The spectrum shows tentative evidence for a water absorption feature in the \$1.1 - 1.7{\textbackslash}mu\$m wavelength range with a small amplitude of 30 ppm (corresponding to just \$0.8 {\textbackslash}pm 0.04\$ atmospheric scale heights). Based on an atmospheric retrieval analysis, the presence of water vapor is tentatively favored with a Bayes factor of 1.7 - 2.6 (depending on prior assumptions).

Cloud-free solar composition atmospheres are ruled out at \${\textgreater}5{\textbackslash}sigma\$ confidence.

These correlations could indicate either more optically thick, photochemically produced hazes at lower T eq and/or higher-metallicity atmospheres for planets with smaller radii and lower f HHe. We derive an analytic relation to estimate the observing time needed with JWST/NIRISS to confidently distinguish a nominal gas giant’s transmission spectrum from a flat line. Using this tool, we show that these possible atmospheric trends could reduce the number of expected TESS planets accessible to JWST spectroscopy by up to a factor of eight. Additional observations of a larger sample of planets are required to confirm these trends in atmospheric properties as a function of planet or system quantities. If these trends can be confidently identified, the community will be well-positioned to prioritize new targets for atmospheric study and eventually break the complex degeneracies between atmospheric chemistry, composition, and cloud properties.},

	abstract = {Phase-curve measurements provide a global view of the composition, thermal structure, and dynamics of exoplanet atmospheres. Although most of the dozens of phase-curve measurements made to date are of large, massive hot Jupiters, there is considerable interest in probing the atmospheres of the smaller planets that are the more typical endproduct of the planet formation process. One such planet that is favorable for these studies is the ultrahot Neptune LTT 9779b, a rare denizen of the Neptune desert. A companion paper presents the planet’s secondary eclipses and dayside thermal emission spectrum; in this work we describe the planet’s optical and infrared phase curves, characterized using a combination of Spitzer and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) photometry. We detect LTT 9779b’s thermal phase variations at 4.5 μm, finding a phase amplitude of 358 ± 106 ppm and no significant phase offset, with a longitude of peak emission occurring −10° ± 21° east of the substellar point. Combined with our secondary eclipse observations, these phase-curve measurements imply a 4.5 μm dayside brightness temperature of 1800 ± 120 K, a nightside brightness temperature of 700 ± 430 K ({\textless}1350 K at 2σ confidence), and a day–night brightness temperature contrast of 1110 ± 460 K. We compare our data to the predictions of 3D general circulation models calculated at multiple metallicity levels and to similar observations of hot Jupiters experiencing similar levels of stellar irradiation. Though not conclusive, our measurement of its small 4.5 μm phase offset, the relatively large amplitude of the phase variation, and the qualitative differences between our target’s dayside emission spectrum and those of hot Jupiters of similar temperatures all suggest a supersolar atmospheric metallicity for LTT 9779b, as might be expected given its size and mass. Finally, we measure the planet’s transits at both 3.6 μm and 4.5 μm, providing a refined ephemeris (P = 0.79207022 ± 0.00000069 days, T 0 = 2458783.51636 ± 0.00027, BJDTDB) that will enable efficient scheduling of future observations to further characterize the atmosphere of this intriguing planet.},

They are a prime example of how exoplanets have challenged our textbook, solar-system inspired story of how planetary systems form and evolve. More than twenty years after the discovery of the first hot Jupiter, there is no consensus on their predominant origin channel. Three classes of hot Jupiter creation hypotheses have been proposed: in situ formation, disk migration, and high eccentricity tidal migration. Although no origin channel alone satisfactorily explains all the evidence, two major origins channels together plausibly account for properties of hot Jupiters themselves and their connections to other exoplanet populations.},

With a mass of Mb = 16.6 +/- 1.3 MEarth, a radius of Rb = 4.71 +/- 0.17 REarth, and an orbital period of P {\textasciitilde} 6 days, HD219666b is a new member of a rare class of exoplanets: the hot-Neptunes. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observed HD219666 (also known as TOI-118) in its Sector 1 and the light curve shows four transit-like events, equally spaced in time. We confirmed the planetary nature of the candidate by gathering precise radial-velocity measurements with HARPS@ESO3.6m. We used the co-added HARPS spectrum to derive the host star fundamental parameters (Teff = 5527 +/- 65 K, log g = 4.40 +/- 0.11 (cgs), [Fe/H]= 0.04 +/- 0.04 dex, log R'HK = -5.07 +/- 0.03), as well as the abundances of many volatile and refractory elements. The host star brightness (V = 9.9) makes it suitable for further characterisation by means of in-transit spectroscopy. The determination of the planet orbital obliquity, along with the atmospheric metal-to-hydrogen content and thermal structure could provide us with important clues on the formation mechanisms of this class of objects.},

	abstract = {The transmission spectra of ultra-hot Jupiters observed shortward of 0.5 μm indicate strong absorption. Previous explanations have included scattering, photochemistry, escaping metals, and disequilibrium chemistry. In this Letter, we show that slopes and features shortward of 0.5 μm can be caused by opacity not commonly considered in atmosphere models of exoplanets but guaranteed to be present if conditions are near chemical equilibrium including, but not limited to, atoms and ions of Fe, Ti, Ni, Ca, Cr, Mn, and SiO. Using the PHOENIX atmosphere model, we describe how the short-wavelength transit spectrum varies with equilibrium temperature between 1000 K and 4000 K, as well as the effect that the rainout of condensates has at these wavelengths. We define two spectral indices to quantify the strength of the NUV and blue absorption compared to that in the red-optical, finding that the NUV transit depth will significantly exceed the transit depth from Rayleigh scattering alone for all hot Jupiters down to around 1000 K. In the blue-optical, hot Jupiters warmer than 2000 K will have transit depths larger than that from Rayleigh scattering, but below 2000 K, Rayleigh scattering can dominate, if present. We further show that these spectral indices may be used to trace the effects of rainout. We then compare our simulated transit spectra to existing observations of WASP-12b, WASP-33b, WASP-76b, and WASP-121b. Further observation of exoplanets at these wavelengths should be prioritized in the coming years as the Hubble Space Telescope nears the end of its operational capability.},

In a few cases, these data have been used to discover additional planets, similar to the historical discovery of Neptune in our own Solar System. However, the more impactful aspect of TTV and TDV studies has been characterization of planetary systems in which multiple planets transit. After addressing the equations of motion and parameter scalings, the main dynamical mechanisms for TTV and TDV are described, with citations to the observational literature for real examples. We describe parameter constraints, particularly the origin of the mass/eccentricity degeneracy and how it is overcome by the high-frequency component of the signal. On the observational side, derivation of timing precision and introduction to the timing diagram are given. Science results are reviewed, with an emphasis on mass measurements of transiting sub-Neptunes and super-Earths, from which bulk compositions may be inferred.},

	abstract = {The nature of aerosols in hot exoplanet atmospheres is one of the primary vexing questions facing the exoplanet field. The complex chemistry, multiple formation pathways, and lack of easily identifiable spectral features associated with aerosols make it especially challenging to constrain their key properties. We propose a transmission spectroscopy technique to identify the primary aerosol formation mechanism for the most highly irradiated hot Jupiters (HIHJs). The technique is based on the expectation that the two key types of aerosols -- photochemically generated hazes and equilibrium condensate clouds -- are expected to form and persist in different regions of a highly irradiated planet's atmosphere. Haze can only be produced on the permanent daysides of tidally-locked hot Jupiters, and will be carried downwind by atmospheric dynamics to the evening terminator (seen as the trailing limb during transit). Clouds can only form in cooler regions on the night side and morning terminator of HIHJs (seen as the leading limb during transit). Because opposite limbs are expected to be impacted by different types of aerosols, ingress and egress spectra, which primarily probe opposing sides of the planet, will reveal the dominant aerosol formation mechanism. We show that the benchmark HIHJ, WASP-121b, has a transmission spectrum consistent with partial aerosol coverage and that ingress-egress spectroscopy would constrain the location and formation mechanism of those aerosols. In general, using this diagnostic we find that observations with JWST and potentially with HST should be able to distinguish between clouds and haze for currently known HIHJs.},

To some degree, all these studies have relied on modeling of JWST's theoretical instrument noise. With under two years left until launch, it is imperative that the exoplanet community begins to digest and integrate these studies into their observing plans, as well as think about how to leverage the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to optimize JWST observations. In order to encourage this and to allow all members of the community access to JWST \& HST noise simulations, we present here an open-source Python package and online interface for creating observation simulations of all observatory-supported time-series spectroscopy modes. This noise simulator, called PandExo, relies on some aspects of Space Telescope Science Institute's Exposure Time Calculator, Pandeia. We describe PandExo and the formalism for computing noise sources for JWST. Then, we benchmark PandExo's performance against each instrument team's independently written noise simulator for JWST, and previous observations for HST.

	abstract = {An intriguing, growing class of planets are the "super-puffs," objects with exceptionally large radii for their masses and thus correspondingly low densities (\${\textbackslash}lesssim0.3{\textbackslash}rm{\textbackslash},g{\textbackslash},cm{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$). Here we consider whether they could have large inferred radii because they are in fact ringed. This would naturally explain why super-puffs have thus far only shown featureless transit spectra. We find that this hypothesis can work in some cases but not all. The close proximity of the super-puffs to their parent stars necessitates rings with a rocky rather than icy composition. This limits the radius of the rings, and makes it challenging to explain the large size of Kepler 51b, 51c, 51d, and 79d unless the rings are composed of porous material. Furthermore, the short tidal locking timescales for Kepler 18d, 223d, and 223e mean that these planets may be spinning too slowly, resulting in a small oblateness and rings that are warped by their parent star. Kepler 87c and 177c have the best chance of being explained by rings. Using transit simulations, we show that testing this hypothesis requires photometry with a precision of somewhere between {\textasciitilde}10 ppm and {\textasciitilde}50 ppm, which roughly scales with the ratio of the planet and star's radii. We conclude with a note about the recently discovered super-puff HIP 41378f.},

To date, exoplanet time-series atmospheric characterization studies have relied on several combinations of modes on Hubble's STIS/COS instruments to access this wavelength regime. Here for the first time, we apply the Hubble WFC3/UVIS G280 grism mode to obtain exoplanet spectroscopy from 200-800 nm in a single observation. We test the G280 grism mode on the hot Jupiter HAT-P-41b over two consecutive transits to determine its viability for exoplanet atmospheric characterization. We obtain a broadband transit depth precision of 29-33ppm and a precision of on average 200ppm in 10nm spectroscopic bins. Spectral information from the G280 grism can be extracted from both the positive and negative first order spectra, resulting in a 60\% increase in the measurable flux. Additionally, the first HST orbit can be fully utilized in the time-series analysis. We present detailed extraction and reduction methods for use by future investigations with this mode, testing multiple techniques. We find the results fully consistent with STIS measurements of HAT-P-41b from 310-800 nm, with the G280 results representing a more observationally efficient and precise spectrum. We fit HAT-P-41b's transmission spectrum with a forward model at Teq=2091K, high metallicity, and significant scattering and cloud opacity. With these first of their kind observations, we demonstrate that WFC3/UVIS G280 is a powerful new tool to obtain UV-optical spectra of exoplanet atmospheres, adding to the UV legacy of Hubble and complementing future observations with the James Webb Space Telescope.},

However, the confirmation of the smallest of {\textless}i{\textgreater}Kepler{\textless}i/{\textgreater}’s candidates in long periods around FGK dwarfs is extremely difficult or even beyond the limit of current radial velocity technology. Transit timing variations (TTVs) may offer the possibility for these confirmations of near-resonant multiple systems by the mutual gravitational interaction of the planets.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}We previously detected the second planet candidate in the KOI 1574 system. The two candidates have relatively long periods (about 114 d and 191 d) and are in 5:3 resonance. We therefore searched for TTVs in this particularly promising system.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}The full {\textless}i{\textgreater}Kepler {\textless}i/{\textgreater}data was detrended with the proven SARS pipeline. The entire data allowed one to search for TTVs of the above signals, and to search for additional transit-like signals.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}We detected strong anti-correlated TTVs of the 114 d and 191 d signals, dynamically confirming them as members of the same system. Dynamical simulations reproducing the observed TTVs allowed us to also determine the masses of the planets. We found KOI 1574.01 (hereafter Kepler-87 b) to have a radius of 13.49 ± 0.55 {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}⊕{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} and a mass of 324.2 ± 8.8 {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}⊕{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}, and KOI 1574.02 (Kepler-87 c) to have a radius of 6.14 ± 0.29 {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}⊕{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} and a mass of 6.4 ± 0.8 {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}⊕{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}. Both planets have low densities of 0.729 and 0.152 g cm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-3{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}, respectively, which is non-trivial for such cold and old (7−8 Gyr) planets. Specifically, Kepler-87 c is the lowest-density planet in the super-Earth mass range. Both planets are thus particularly amenable to modeling and planetary structure studies, and also present an interesting case where ground-based photometric follow-up of {\textless}i{\textgreater}Kepler {\textless}i/{\textgreater}planets is very desirable. Finally, we also detected two more short-period super-Earth sized ({\textless}2 {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}⊕{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}) planetary candidates in the system, making the relatively high multiplicity of this system notable against the general paucity of multiple systems in the presence of giant planets like Kepler-87 b.},

	abstract = {We present Hubble Space Telescope optical and near-ultraviolet transmission spectra of the transiting hot-Jupiter HD189733b, taken with the repaired Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) instrument. The resulting spectra cover the range 2900-5700 Ang and reach per-exposure signal-to-noise levels greater than 11,000 within a 500 Ang bandwidth. We used time series spectra obtained during two transit events to determine the wavelength dependance of the planetary radius and measure the exoplanet's atmospheric transmission spectrum for the first time over this wavelength range. Our measurements, in conjunction with existing HST spectra, now provide a broadband transmission spectrum covering the full optical regime. The STIS data also shows unambiguous evidence of a large occulted stellar spot during one of our transit events, which we use to place constraints on the characteristics of the K dwarf's stellar spots, estimating spot temperatures around Teff{\textasciitilde}4250 K. With contemporaneous ground-based photometric monitoring of the stellar variability, we also measure the correlation between the stellar activity level and transit-measured planet-to-star radius contrast, which is in good agreement with predictions. We find a planetary transmission spectrum in good agreement with that of Rayleigh scattering from a high-altitude atmospheric haze as previously found from HST ACS camera. The high-altitude haze is now found to cover the entire optical regime and is well characterised by Rayleigh scattering. These findings suggest that haze may be a globally dominant atmospheric feature of the planet which would result in a high optical albedo at shorter optical wavelengths.},

We detected prominent H2O absorption bands with a maximum base-to-peak amplitude of 525ppm in the transmission spectrum. Using the water abundance as a proxy for metallicity, we measured HAT-P-26b's atmospheric heavy element content [4.8 (-4.0 +21.5) times solar]. This likely indicates that HAT-P-26b's atmosphere is primordial and obtained its gaseous envelope late in its disk lifetime, with little contamination from metal-rich planetesimals.},

	abstract = {Exoplanetary transmission spectroscopy in the near-infrared using Hubble/NICMOS is currently ambiguous because different observational groups claim different results from the same data, depending on their analysis methodologies. Spatial scanning with Hubble/WFC3 provides an opportunity to resolve this ambiguity. We here report WFC3 spectroscopy of the giant planets HD209458b and XO-1b in transit, using spatial scanning mode for maximum photon-collecting efficiency. We introduce an analysis technique that derives the exoplanetary transmission spectrum without the necessity of explicitly decorrelating instrumental effects, and achieves nearly photon-limited precision even at the high flux levels collected in spatial scan mode. Our errors are within 6-percent (XO-1) and 26-percent (HD209458b) of the photon-limit at a spectral resolving power of 70, and are better than 0.01-percent per spectral channel. Both planets exhibit water absorption of approximately 200 ppm at the water peak near 1.38 microns. Our result for XO-1b contradicts the much larger absorption derived from NICMOS spectroscopy. The weak water absorption we measure for HD209458b is reminiscent of the weakness of sodium absorption in the first transmission spectroscopy of an exoplanet atmosphere by Charbonneau et al. (2002). Model atmospheres having uniformly-distributed extra opacity of 0.012 cm{\textasciicircum}2 per gram account approximately for both our water measurement and the sodium absorption in this planet. Our results for HD209458b support the picture advocated by Pont et al. (2013) in which weak molecular absorptions are superposed on a transmission spectrum that is dominated by continuous opacity due to haze and/or dust. However, the extra opacity needed for HD209458b is grayer than for HD189733b, with a weaker Rayleigh component.},

	abstract = {Extremely low density planets ('super-puffs') are a small but intriguing subset of the transiting planet population. With masses in the super-Earth range (\$1-10\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$) and radii akin to those of giant planets (\${\textgreater}4\$ R\$\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$), their large envelopes may have been accreted beyond the water snow line and many appear to be susceptible to catastrophic mass loss. Both the presence of water and the importance of mass loss can be explored using transmission spectroscopy. Here, we present new HST WFC3 spectroscopy and updated Kepler transit depth measurements for the super-puff Kepler-79d. We do not detect any molecular absorption features in the \$1.1-1.7\$ \${\textbackslash}mu\$m WFC3 bandpass and the combination of Kepler and WFC3 data are consistent with a flat line model, indicating the presence of aerosols in the atmosphere. We compare the shape of Kepler-79d's transmission spectrum to predictions from a microphysical haze model that incorporates an outward particle flux due to ongoing mass loss. We find that photochemical hazes offer an attractive explanation for the observed properties of super-puffs like Kepler-79d, as they simultaneously render the near-infrared spectrum featureless and reduce the inferred envelope mass loss rate by moving the measured radius (optical depth unity surface during transit) to lower pressures. We revisit the broader question of mass loss rates for super-puffs and find that the age estimates and mass loss rates for the majority of super-puffs can be reconciled if hazes move the photosphere from the typically assumed pressure of \${\textbackslash}sim 10\$ mbar to \${\textbackslash}sim 10 {\textbackslash}; {\textbackslash}mu\$bar.},

	abstract = {Direct and statistical observational evidences suggest that photoevaporation is important in eroding the atmosphere of sub-Neptune planets. We construct full hydrodynamic simulations, coupled with consistent thermochemistry and ray-tracing radiative transfer, to understand the physics of atmospheric photoevaporation caused by high energy photons from the host star. We identify a region on the parameter space where a hydrostatic atmosphere cannot be balanced by any plausible interplanetary pressure, so that the atmosphere is particularly susceptible to loss by Parker wind. This region may lead an absence of rich atmosphere (substantially H/He) for planets with low mass (M {\textasciitilde} 3 M\_earth). Improving on previous works, our simulations include detailed microphysics and a self-consistent thermochemical network. Full numerical simulations of photoevaporative outflows shows a typical outflow speed {\textasciitilde} 30 km/s and Mdot {\textasciitilde} 4e-10 M\_earth/yr for a 5 M\_earth fiducial model rocky-core planet with 1e-2 of its mass in the atmosphere. Supersonic outflows are not quenched by stellar wind ram pressure (up to 5 times the total pressure at transonic points of the fiducial model). The outflows modulated by stellar wind are collimated towards the night side of the planet, while the mass loss rate is only {\textasciitilde} 25\% lower than the fiducial model. By exploring the parameter space, we find that EUV photoionization is most important in launching photoevaporative wind. Other energetic radiation, including X-ray, are of secondary importance. The leading cooling mechanism is ro-vibrational molecular cooling and adiabatic expansion rather than recombination or Ly alpha cooling. The wind speed is considerably higher than the escape velocity at the wind base in most cases, hence the mass loss rate is proportional to the second power of the EUV photosphere size R\_euv, instead of the third, as suggested by previous works...},

	abstract = {The observed mass-radius relationship of low-mass planets informs our understanding of their composition and evolution. Recent discoveries of low mass, large radii objects ("super-puffs") have challenged theories of planet formation and atmospheric loss, as their high inferred gas masses make them vulnerable to runaway accretion and hydrodynamic escape. Here we propose that high altitude photochemical hazes could enhance the observed radii of low-mass planets and explain the nature of super-puffs. We construct model atmospheres in radiative-convective equilibrium and compute rates of atmospheric escape and haze distributions, taking into account haze coagulation, sedimentation, diffusion, and advection by an outflow wind. We develop mass-radius diagrams that include atmospheric lifetimes and haze opacity, which is enhanced by the outflow, such that young ({\textasciitilde}0.1-1 Gyr), warm (T\$\_\{eq\}\$ \${\textbackslash}geq\$ 500 K), low mass objects (\$M\_c\$ {\textless} 4M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm Earth\}\$) should experience the most apparent radius enhancement due to hazes, reaching factors of three. This reconciles the densities and ages of the most extreme super-puffs. For Kepler-51b, the inclusion of hazes reduces its inferred gas mass fraction to {\textless}10\%, similar to that of planets on the large radius side of the sub-Neptune radius gap. This suggests that Kepler-51b may be evolving towards that population, and that some warm sub-Neptunes may have evolved from super-puffs. Hazes also render transmission spectra of super-puffs and sub-Neptunes featureless, consistent with recent measurements. Our hypothesis can be tested by future observations of super-puffs' transmission spectra at mid-infrared wavelengths, where we predict that the planet radius will be half of that observed in the near-infrared.},

	abstract = {The Kepler mission revealed a class of planets known as ''super-puffs,'' with masses only a few times larger than Earth's but radii larger than Neptune, giving them very low mean densities. All three of the known planets orbiting the young solar-type star Kepler 51 are super-puffs. The Kepler 51 system thereby provides an opportunity for a comparative study of the structures and atmospheres of this mysterious class of planets, which may provide clues about their formation and evolution. We observed two transits each of Kepler 51b and 51d with the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on the Hubble Space Telescope. Combining new WFC3 transit times with re-analyzed Kepler data and updated stellar parameters, we confirmed that all three planets have densities lower than 0.1 g/cm\${\textasciicircum}\{3\}\$. We measured the WFC3 transmission spectra to be featureless between 1.15 and 1.63 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m, ruling out any variations greater than 0.6 scale heights (assuming a H/He dominated atmosphere), thus showing no significant water absorption features. We interpreted the flat spectra as the result of a high-altitude aerosol layer (pressure \${\textless}\$3 mbar) on each planet. Adding this new result to the collection of flat spectra that have been observed for other sub-Neptune planets, we find support for one of the two hypotheses introduced by Crossfield and Kreidberg (2017), that planets with cooler equilibrium temperatures have more high-altitude aerosols. We strongly disfavor their other hypothesis that the H/He mass fraction drives the appearance of large amplitude transmission features.},

One way to break that degeneracy is via statistical studies. We collect all published HST/WFC3 transit spectra for 1.1-1.65 μm water vapor
absorption and perform a statistical study on potential correlations between the water absorption feature and planetary parameters. We fit the observed spectra with a template calculated for each planet using the Exo-transmit code. We express the magnitude of the water absorption in scale heights, thereby removing the known dependence on temperature, surface gravity, and mean molecular weight. We find that the absorption in scale heights has a positive baseline correlation with planetary equilibrium temperature; our hypothesis is that decreasing cloud condensation with increasing temperature is responsible for this baseline slope. However, the observed sample is also intrinsically degenerate in the sense that equilibrium temperature correlates with planetary mass. We compile the distribution of absorption in scale heights, and we find that this distribution is closer to log-normal than Gaussian. However, we also find that the distribution of equilibrium temperatures for the observed planets is similarly log-normal. This indicates that the absorption values are affected by observational bias, whereby observers have not yet targeted a sufficient sample of the hottest planets.},
